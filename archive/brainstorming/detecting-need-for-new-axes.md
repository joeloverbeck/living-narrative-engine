# Detecting the need for new axes

This is regarding the page prototype-analysis.html . The report reports/prototype-analysis-system.md is a current overview of the system.

One important aspect is whether the analysis system can recognize when a prototype doesn’t neatly fit the existing mood axes – i.e., when an emotion is effectively “overfitting” multiple axes to express a concept that might deserve its own axis. The example cited is “confusion” and the missing “uncertainty” mood axis.

Currently, the overlap analyzer is not explicitly designed to suggest new axes; its focus is on pruning or merging redundant prototypes given the current axis space. However, by examining its outputs, we can infer situations that hint at a missing dimension:

## Prototype overlaps spread across multiple others

If a prototype shows moderate overlap with several different prototypes but isn’t a near-duplicate of any single one, it can indicate that it’s combining aspects of those emotions without exactly matching any. This was the case for Confusion. Before the introduction of an uncertainty axis, confusion was defined by a mix of axes (some negative valence, lowered agency_control, some arousal/engagement). It shared the sign pattern of a negative-valence, low-agency state, thus overlapping with emotions like frustration and helplessness which also have agency_control↓ and valence↓. The analyzer likely would have flagged confusion as having high active-axis overlap and sign agreement with frustration (both had engagement up somewhat, agency_control down, valence down), possibly making it a Stage A candidate. In Stage B, their gate overlap might be high (frustration’s conditions often imply confusion’s, as noted), but their Pearson correlation perhaps not extremely high because confusion’s intensity profile differed (confusion might not get as intense in some cases). The result might be the system classifying them as distinct but similar (overlap info). This “overlap but not mergeable” outcome is a red flag: it tells the designer that confusion is sitting in a crowded portion of mood space (the “low agency, unpleasant” region) yet is meant to represent something conceptually unique (an epistemic state of disorientation).

## Consistent one-way overlaps (nested siblings) pointing to an unseen factor

In the frustration vs confusion analysis, it emerged that whenever frustration was present, confusion was likely present too (because confusion’s simple gate agency_control <= 0.2 was almost always satisfied alongside frustration’s more complex gates). But not vice versa – confusion could occur without full frustration (e.g., one can be confused without the agitation of frustration). This pattern (frustration implies confusion, but confusion does not fully imply frustration) suggests confusion was a more foundational state in that relationship. It was indicating an aspect of experience (cognitive uncertainty) that frustration also contains when it occurs. The analyzer labeling this relationship (in a refined version) as nested and providing evidence (“frustration implies confusion”) is essentially highlighting that confusion has a broader significance. In general, if prototype A implies prototype B, but B doesn’t imply A, it may be that B represents a more fundamental dimension that A also taps into when A is present. Here, confusion/uncertainty was that fundamental dimension lacking a proper axis. Indeed, the team recognized that confusion and several related prototypes (perplexity, doubt, curiosity, etc.) all shared an epistemic quality not captured by existing axes. They decided to introduce a new “uncertainty” axis to explicitly model that quality.

## Prototype with many active axes and conflicting influences

Another sign is if a single prototype uses an unusually large number of axes (especially if some push positive and others negative in a balancing act). Confusion again was an example: it had six different axes with non-trivial weights (engagement+, arousal+, inhibitory_control+, valence–, agency_control–, self_control– in the original definition). This scatter of influences implied that to achieve the nuanced feeling of confusion (high mental engagement but low understanding, some stress but not outright fear), the prototype was “borrowing” from multiple axes. That can be seen as overfitting: the engine’s mood space lacked a single axis to represent “cognitive dissonance,” so the prototype had to jury-rig a combination. The analyzer would see confusion as active on many axes. If one were to cluster prototypes in weight space, confusion might stand out as not aligning cleanly with any one cluster defined by a primary axis – instead it mixes elements. Such an outlier could hint “this doesn’t belong in the existing 9 dimensions”.

In the current system, these conditions would not directly output “needs new axis”. The identification of missing axes still requires human insight. The analyzer provides evidence like “Prototype A looks structurally similar but not redundant with others” – from there, a developer might notice a pattern among those “not redundant but similar” cases. For confusion, the devs did exactly that: they observed confusion was overlapping with frustration/anxiety but clearly qualitatively different, prompting the addition of a new axis.

## Could the system be extended to flag such cases automatically?

Potentially yes, through additional analyses:

### Cluster and Principal Component Analysis

By analyzing the prototype weight matrix, one could detect if an extra principal component (beyond the current axes) accounts for variance in several prototypes’ definitions. For instance, an algorithm could find that a combination of existing axes – say, +engagement, –agency_control, ±valence, etc. – keeps appearing together in a set of prototypes (confusion, curiosity, perplexity…). This might correspond to a new latent axis. In fact, adding the uncertainty axis re-expressed those prototypes more cleanly.

### Coverage Gap Detection

The team’s brainstorming on expression gaps suggests a method: treat each prototype as a point in a feature space (weights + gate constraints), and see if an expression’s desired point falls far from all prototypes. Similarly, we could check if there’s a region of mood space (like high uncertainty) that is not well spanned by the current axes or prototypes. If multiple prototypes cluster in an odd region, perhaps that region would be better served by a new axis basis. For confusion’s case, the “epistemic state” region was not explicitly an axis until recognized.

### Overlapping Many-Prototype Analysis

If one prototype overlaps at least moderately (above some threshold) with several others across different clusters, it might be trying to cover a multi-dimensional concept. Confusion overlapped with frustration, and also with perplexity or doubt (which likely were defined similarly and also got revamped with uncertainty axis). If the analyzer reports numerous overlap info relations for one prototype across the board, that could trigger a “prototype spans multiple concepts – consider new axis or splitting it” insight.

In summary, the current system’s capacity to detect a missing axis is indirect – it can highlight odd overlap patterns (like confusion being nested under frustration, etc., without being a merge case) but it does not declare “new axis needed.” Making this explicit would require higher-level interpretation of the overlap results or additional analyses as described. The confusion example proved that by interpreting the analysis (confusion overlapped too much with others in the wrong way), developers identified the gap. Going forward, the system could incorporate logic to detect clusters of prototypes that systematically co-occur or correlate in a way not explained by any single existing axis, as a prompt for axis augmentation. For instance, after adding the uncertainty axis, confusion’s definition became much cleaner (uncertainty weight 1.0, less reliance on agency_control↓) – the analyzer would then likely find confusion and frustration less overlapping in the new space, confirming the benefit of the new axis.
