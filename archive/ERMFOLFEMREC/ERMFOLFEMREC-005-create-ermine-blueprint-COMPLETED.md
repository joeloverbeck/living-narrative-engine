# ERMFOLFEMREC-005: Create ermine-folk female blueprint (COMPLETED)

## Outcome
- Added `data/mods/dredgers/blueprints/ermine_folk_female.blueprint.json` composing `dredgers:mustelid_core` with ear/tail/breast/vagina slots and socket-safe clothing mappings per spec.
- Registered the new blueprint and existing torso definition in `data/mods/dredgers/mod-manifest.json` so the blueprint root resolves during validation.

## Notes
- Ran `npm run validate:quick` to confirm schema and cross-reference consistency.
