  I've successfully implemented the fix for the Joel Overberus empty description issue. The
  solution addresses the timing problem where body part descriptions were being updated via
  componentManager.addComponent() but the bodyDescriptionComposer was trying to read them
  immediately after, resulting in empty values.

  Changes Made:

  1. AnatomyDescriptionService.generateAllDescriptions(): Now collects generated part
  descriptions in a Map and passes it to generateBodyDescription()
  2. AnatomyDescriptionService.generatePartDescription(): Now returns the generated description
   for immediate use
  3. AnatomyDescriptionService.generateBodyDescription(): Updated to accept an optional
  partDescriptions Map parameter and pass it to the composer
  4. BodyDescriptionComposer.composeDescription(): Updated to accept an optional
  partDescriptions Map and pass it to createStructuredLine()
  5. BodyDescriptionComposer.createStructuredLine(): Enhanced to first check the
  partDescriptions Map for pre-generated descriptions before falling back to reading from
  entity components

  This solution ensures that the body description composer has immediate access to all
  generated part descriptions, eliminating the timing issue where component updates might not
  be immediately visible. The implementation maintains backward compatibility by making all new
   parameters optional.
