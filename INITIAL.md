## FEATURE:

The files src/anatomy/validation/validationRule.js and src/anatomy/workflows/graphBuildingWorkflow.js are insufficiently covered by test suites. Run 'npm run test' to get the test coverage, and create comprehensive test suites to cover both modules to as close to 100% as possible.

## EXAMPLES:

The unit tests are in tests/unit/ . If you think that integration tests are warranted for this task, they are in tests/integration/

## DOCUMENTATION:

We use Jest for our unit tests.

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

Once you've performed your changes, run 'npm run test' and ensure all tests pass.
