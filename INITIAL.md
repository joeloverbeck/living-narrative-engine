## FEATURE:

We have created a body graph visualizer. The entry point is in anatomy-visualizer.html, and the main code entry point is src/anatomy-visualizer.js . On the left panel of the anatomy visualization page, whole body graphs are being displayed, with all nods and child nods connected with bezier curves. However, the current visualization shows the depth level in "tiers": all nodes that are children of the root are in a row under the root node, and the children that are two nodes away from the root are shown in the second row, under the first row. That causes many bezier curves to overlap, and the general display is confusing. I want you to figure out a way to instead display a radial expanse of nodes, ensuring programatically that the nodes are distanced away from their siblings to that their bezier curves don't overlap. Given that we can pan the visualization, there's no problem if the display of nodes ends up being quite wide and/or tall. I imagine, for example, all the children of the root node displayed in a circle around the root node, radiating away from it, and the children of those child nodes will radiate in a similar way from their parents. Ensuring that there is no overlap of bezier curves is important for proper visualization.

Your goal is to create a comprehensive PRP that will implement this change. Do not modify any code yet; we will implement the PRP at a later date.

## EXAMPLES:

You have passing test suites for the anatomy visualizer in tests/unit/visualizer/ , as well as in tests/integration/domUI/AnatomyVisualizerUI.integration.test.js

## DOCUMENTATION:

You can rely on the schemas for recipes and blueprints of the anatomy system, located in data/schemas/ . You can also analyze the code in src/anatomy/ and subdirectories, to see how the body parts graph gets created.

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

You should create focused tests to ensure the proper implementation gets locked down.
