## FEATURE:

Important: your current goal is to create a PRP document. No code modifications should be made at this stage.

We have recently implemented custom JsonLogic operators in src/logic/jsonLogicCustomOperators.js . We've had trouble making the custom operators process their related actions properly, but now that everything is working as it should in production, I want you to analyze the module jsonLogicCustomOperators.js in depth looking to refactor it thoroughly based on the refactoring principles contained in the file REFACTORING_PRINCIPLES.md

Your task is to create a comprehensive PRP document to implement these changes.

## EXAMPLES:

Test suites for jsonLogicCustomOperators.js must be working. Look them over and analyze them to be sure how the code in jsonLogicCustomOperators.js works.

## DOCUMENTATION:

The document REFACTORING_PRINCIPLES.md is vital to focus on what refactoring principles this thorough refactoring we want to make should adhere to.

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

None in particular.
