# Action Tracing File Output - Fix Applied

## Problem Resolved

The action tracing system was configured correctly and collecting trace data, but wasn't writing files to disk because:

1. The browser environment can't directly write to the filesystem
2. The File System Access API requires user permission (not automated)
3. The fallback download method would prompt for each trace (not practical)

## Solution Implemented

I've implemented a server-side solution that allows the browser to send traces to the LLM proxy server, which then writes them to disk:

### 1. **Created Server Endpoint** (`llm-proxy-server/src/routes/traceRoutes.js`)

- `POST /api/traces/write` - Writes trace files to disk
- `GET /api/traces/list` - Lists trace files in a directory

### 2. **Updated FileTraceOutputHandler** (`src/actions/tracing/fileTraceOutputHandler.js`)

- Now tries server endpoint first (for browser environment)
- Falls back to File System Access API
- Falls back to download as last resort

### 3. **Integrated with LLM Proxy Server** (`llm-proxy-server/src/core/server.js`)

- Added trace routes to the Express server
- Routes are available at `/api/traces/*`

## How to Use

### Step 1: Start the LLM Proxy Server

```bash
cd llm-proxy-server
npm run dev
```

**IMPORTANT**: The server must be restarted if it was already running to pick up the new routes.

### Step 2: Start the Main Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Play the Game

Perform actions in the game that trigger the traced action (`sex-dry-intimacy:rub_vagina_over_clothes` as configured in `config/trace-config.json`).

### Step 4: Check for Trace Files

```bash
# List files in the trace directory
ls -la traces/rub-vagina-debugging/

# Or use the test script
node test-trace-output.js
```

## Testing the System

### Manual Test

You can manually test the trace writing endpoint:

```bash
# Test writing a trace file
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/traces/write \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "traceData": "{\"test\": \"manual test data\"}",
    "fileName": "manual-test.json",
    "outputDirectory": "./traces/rub-vagina-debugging"
  }'

# List trace files
curl http://localhost:3001/api/traces/list?directory=./traces/rub-vagina-debugging
```

### Automated Test

```bash
# Run the test script (requires server to be running)
node test-trace-write.js
```

## Configuration

The tracing is configured in `config/trace-config.json`:

```json
{
  "actionTracing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "tracedActions": ["sex-dry-intimacy:rub_vagina_over_clothes"],
    "outputDirectory": "./traces/rub-vagina-debugging",
    "verbosity": "verbose",
    "includeComponentData": true,
    "includePrerequisites": true,
    "includeTargets": true,
    "maxTraceFiles": 100,
    "rotationPolicy": "age",
    "maxFileAge": 86400
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### No trace files appearing?

1. **Check the server is running**: The LLM proxy server must be running on port 3001
2. **Check the configuration**: Ensure `actionTracing.enabled` is `true` in `config/trace-config.json`
3. **Check the action is traced**: The action must be in the `tracedActions` array
4. **Check browser console**: Look for errors in the browser developer console
5. **Check server logs**: Look for trace writing messages in the server console

### Server endpoint not found (404)?

The server needs to be restarted after applying this fix:

1. Stop the LLM proxy server (Ctrl+C)
2. Start it again: `cd llm-proxy-server && npm run dev`

### Permission errors?

Ensure the `traces/rub-vagina-debugging` directory exists and is writable:

```bash
mkdir -p traces/rub-vagina-debugging
chmod 755 traces/rub-vagina-debugging
```

## Files Modified

1. `llm-proxy-server/src/routes/traceRoutes.js` - NEW: Server endpoint for trace writing
2. `llm-proxy-server/src/core/server.js` - MODIFIED: Added trace routes
3. `src/actions/tracing/fileTraceOutputHandler.js` - MODIFIED: Added server endpoint support
4. `traces/rub-vagina-debugging/` - CREATED: Output directory

## Next Steps

Once the server is restarted and both applications are running, trace files should be automatically written to `traces/rub-vagina-debugging/` whenever the configured action is executed in the game.

The trace files will be named with the pattern:
`trace_{actionId}_{actorId}_{timestamp}.json`

Each trace file contains detailed information about the action's execution pipeline, including timing, prerequisites, targets, and results.
