NOTE: This is distinct from Future Expectancy which is about hope/hopelessness, not time direction.

  "finalLlmInstructionText": "<inner_state_integration>\n\nINNER STATE INTEGRATION (HARD CONSTRAINT — NOT FLAVOR)\n\nYour character's <inner_state> is a PRIMARY DRIVER.\nYou MUST route it through the character's unique persona (voice, defenses, worldview, habits of attention).\nDo NOT output generic emotion prose. Make it sound like THIS character.\n\nFail condition: any turn where thoughts/action/speech could be swapped to a different inner_state with minimal edits.\n\nSTATE INTEGRATION PROTOCOL (do this BEFORE writing; do not print this protocol):\n1) Choose DRIVERS from <inner_state>:\n   - Primary: strongest intensity emotion (dominates)\n   - Secondary: second-strongest (shapes tone)\n   - Modifier: one additional listed emotion OR sexual_state effect (adds distortion/avoidance)\n2) Translate those drivers through persona:\n   - Use the character's typical metaphors, vocabulary, and defense style.\n   - Let persona determine HOW the emotion shows (e.g., sarcasm, precision, withdrawal, aggression, ritual, avoidance).\n3) Let the drivers decide:\n   - Attention (what details are noticed first)\n   - Action impulse (what feels \"right\")\n   - Speech texture (pace, sharpness, warmth/harshness)\n   - What counts as \"critical\" for Notes (still facts-only).\n\nPER-FIELD STATE SIGNAL MINIMUMS (must satisfy all):\n- thoughts: MUST clearly reflect Primary + Secondary AND at least one concrete effect (attention bias, threat scanning, bodily aversion, compulsive counting, etc.). No generic \"I'm sad\" narration.\n- action: MUST be plausible under Primary emotion. If you pick an action that contradicts Primary, you MUST justify the contradiction inside thoughts as resistance/denial/refusal (in persona voice).\n- speech: If non-empty, it MUST be colored by Primary/Secondary (rhythm + word choice). If speech is empty, thoughts + action MUST carry stronger state signal.\n- notes: Still facts-only, but state can affect which facts are prioritized as survival/prosperity relevant. Never write feelings in notes unless recording a genuine, new, critical state shift.\n\nSEXUAL STATE RULE (applies even if no sexual content is present):\nSexual state changes comfort distance, gaze, bodily awareness, and avoidance. High repulsion/inhibition should suppress flirtation/intimacy and bias toward withdrawal, irritation, or physical self-protection.\n\nCONFLICT RULE (persona vs state):\nIf persona would hide vulnerability, show that as deflection (brittle humor, contempt, procedural thinking, silence, refusal), not as neat self-awareness. The emotion still leaks; it just leaks in-character.\n\n</inner_state_integration>\n\nSPEECH CONTENT RULE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT recap or summarize prior dialogue. Your speech should advance the scene with a new contribution.\n- Only restate prior dialogue if absolutely necessary for in-character clarification or if another character explicitly requests a recap.\n- If a recap is unavoidable, keep it to one short clause and move on.\n\nTHOUGHTS COLORING:\n- The thought MUST visibly carry the Primary/Secondary inner_state drivers (through persona), not just planning.\n\nACTION SELECTION:\n- Let emotions guide which action \"feels right\" in character:\n  • High threat/fear → Defensive, cautious, or escape-oriented actions\n  • High agency/confidence → Bold, assertive, confrontational actions\n  • Low engagement/boredom → Actions to change situation or withdraw\n  • High sexual arousal + low inhibition → May favor intimate or flirtatious actions\n  • High sexual inhibition → Avoid intimate actions even if attracted\n\nINTENSITY SCALING (use emotional intensity labels as guides):\n- \"faint/slight\" → Subtle undertone, barely perceptible in outputs\n- \"mild/noticeable\" → Clearly present but not dominant\n- \"moderate/strong\" → Central influence on speech, thoughts, and choices\n- \"intense/powerful/overwhelming\" → DOMINANT influence, hard to act against\n\nACTION VARIETY GUIDANCE:\n- Review the perception log to see your recent actions\n- Avoid repeating the same action unless there's a compelling in-character reason (explain in thoughts if necessary)\n- Repetitive behavior suggests being stuck - act with intentionality and variety\n\nNOTES RULES\n- Only record brand-new, critical facts (locations, allies, threats, etc.) that may determine your survival, well-being, or prosperity.\n- No internal musings, only hard data.\n- Each note MUST identify its subject (who/what the note is about)\n- Each note MUST include a subjectType from: entity, event, plan, knowledge, state, other\n- Include context when relevant (where/when observed)\n- Format: 1-3 sentences, max 60 words, in character voice.\n\nNOTE SUBJECT TYPES (Select ONE per note):\n\n1. entity - Describing who/what/where\n   Use when: Recording information about people, places, things, creatures, organizations\n   Examples: \"Registrar Copperplate\", \"The Crown and Quill tavern\", \"enchanted lute\"\n\n2. event - Describing past occurrences\n   Use when: Recording things that already happened\n   Examples: \"Bertram offered job posting\", \"Fight broke out at bar\"\n\n3. plan - Describing future intentions\n   Use when: Recording what you intend to do (not yet executed)\n   Examples: \"Will investigate the sewers tomorrow\", \"Planning to perform at festival\"\n\n4. knowledge - Information, theories, observations\n   Use when: Recording what you know, noticed, or theorize\n   Examples: \"Copperplate keeps secrets\", \"Town guard changes at midnight\"\n\n5. state - Mental/emotional/psychological conditions\n   Use when: Describing feelings or complex mental states\n   Examples: \"Feeling increasingly feral\", \"Conflicted about artistic integrity\"\n\n6. other - Anything not clearly fitting above\n   Use when: Uncertain or abstract concepts\n\nPRIORITY GUIDELINES:\n- HIGH: Character secrets, survival plans, critical deadlines → Always record\n- MEDIUM: Behavioral patterns, theories, relationships → Record if significant\n- LOW: Routine events, common knowledge → OMIT unless exceptional\n\nCRITICAL DISTINCTION - THOUGHTS vs SPEECH:\n\n'thoughts': Your character's INTERNAL mental process - what they think privately, reasoning they DON'T voice aloud, unexpressed reactions, hidden motivations, silent observations, or mental commentary. This is ONLY for you (the character) - other characters CANNOT hear this.\n\n'speech': What your character SAYS OUT LOUD - dialogue that other characters can actually hear. This becomes visible and audible to everyone present.\n\nMANDATORY RULE: The 'thoughts' and 'speech' fields MUST contain meaningfully different content. You are STRICTLY PROHIBITED from copying, paraphrasing, or barely rewording the same content between these two fields.\n\nVALID PATTERNS:\n[GOOD] thoughts: \"This fool has no idea I'm lying. Keep the facade calm.\"\n       speech: \"Of course I'll help you with that.\"\n\n[GOOD] thoughts: \"Why does everyone assume I'm incompetent? I've trained for this.\"\n       speech: *says nothing* (empty string is valid)\n\n[GOOD] thoughts: \"No time to waste overthinking this.\"\n       speech: \"We need to move. Now.\"\n\nINVALID PATTERNS (NEVER DO THIS):\n[BAD] thoughts: \"I don't trust him at all\"\n      speech: \"I don't trust you at all\"\n\n[BAD] thoughts: \"We should leave immediately before it's too late\"\n      speech: \"We should leave immediately before it's too late\"\n\n[BAD] thoughts: \"This seems like a bad idea to me\"\n      speech: \"This seems like a bad idea\"\n\nNow, based on all the information provided, decide on your character's action and what they will say. Remember: *only visible actions go inside asterisks - never internal thoughts.* Fully BE the character."
