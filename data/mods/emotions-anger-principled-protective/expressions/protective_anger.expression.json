Heat lifts behind my ribs, but it organizes itself into a single instruction: stop. My voice steadies. My eyes narrow, not to punish, but to aim. I can feel the shape of the boundary I want and the exact words that draw it. I'm not looking to win an argument; I'm looking to make the danger understand the rules. If I have to escalate, I will—but it's a choice, not a leak. I'm present, focused, and angry on purpose.",
