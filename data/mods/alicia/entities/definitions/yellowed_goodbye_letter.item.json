      "text": "December 22, 1972\nStella Maris\nBobby,\nThe probability of you reading this approaches zero. The doctors said \"braindead\"—past tense, declarative, clinically certain. But I cannot pull the plug. I fled instead. So this letter exists in a superposition state: written but unread, meant for you but addressed to no one. Schrödinger's goodbye.\nIf you are reading this, then something impossible happened. You woke up. The substrate repaired itself against all medical prediction. In which case, you should know: on the 24th—Christmas Eve, because apparently I have a taste for symbolic timing—I intend to walk into the woods behind the sanatorium and let the Wisconsin winter finish what Lake Tahoe started.\nI am trying to explain this rationally, but the premises keep collapsing: Premise One: You were my only tether to continued existence. Premise Two: Without you conscious in the world, the equation no longer balances. Conclusion: Death is the optimal solution. But even I can see the flaw in my logic. I have spent twenty-two years analyzing everything except the one variable that matters: that I want to die has been true longer than you have been in a coma. The coma is just the excuse my mind has been waiting for.\nYou used to take me to that bar in Nashville. Jazz on Thursdays. You would order whiskey and I would watch the colors the saxophone made—ambers and deep golds, spiraling up into the smoke. You never tried to fix me during those nights. You just sat there, let me talk about Gödel or Cantor or whatever mathematical dead-end I was pursuing that month. You listened without needing me to be different. I miss that. I miss you. I miss my brother so much it aches behind my ribs.\nThere are things I need you to know, in the infinitesimal probability you are reading this: One: None of this is your fault. I know your patterns, Bobby. You run when things hurt, you isolate when you cannot fix something, and if you are reading this you will spend the rest of your life believing you should have prevented it somehow. You could not have. This was always the trajectory. I am my parents' daughter—both of them. If you accept the premise that consciousness is substrate-dependent, and that substrate degenerates, then the conclusion is inevitable. You were not the variable. You were just the last reason I had to delay the inevitable. Two: I deliberately left Granellen behind without saying goodbye. She is old, Bobby. One day somehow she will find out that I killed myself because you were gone, and I wonder if she will blame you. Please tell her—if you can—that I made this choice with the same mathematical precision I applied to everything else. It was not impulse. It was calculation. Maybe that will help. Probably it will not. Three: I died a virgin. Twenty-two years old and I never let anyone close enough. Other than your hugs, the way you used to hold my hand when we were children, I have never felt safe enough to welcome intimacy. I used to imagine my first time... someone looking down at me with tenderness, entering me like a cathedral. Reverent. Gentle. I wanted to be touched like I mattered. I will never know that. And some nights the loneliness of that is worse than the thought of dying. The loneliness is not metaphorical. It is a measurable absence, like a vacuum. Four: The inheritance money from Grandfather—you bought that race car and crashed it in Italy and ended up braindead, and I cannot even be angry at you for it because at least you lived before the crash. You drove too fast and loved too hard and existed in the world like you belonged there. I never learned how. You squeezed everything out of your twenty-six years. I spent twenty-two calculating and never participating. Five: Sometimes I just wanted to buy groceries with someone and argue about peaches. That is all. A small, domestic life. A child maybe. Someone to hold. Someone who needed me to stay alive. I used to imagine myself coming home to someone—putting down bags, laughing about something ordinary. It feels like a fantasy belonging to a different version of me. One who was not born like this. Six: The mathematics failed me. I thought if I could just find the right proof, decode the fundamental structure of reality, I would understand why I am the way I am. Why my mind works like this. Why I am so profoundly alone. But math is unable to grasp the entirety of reality. Perhaps reality itself is artificial. Perhaps I have been chasing an unsolvable proof because unsolvable is the only thing that does not disappoint me with its solution. Seven: I lied to my therapist here. I have been testing whether he will notice the inconsistencies. Treating our professional relationship as an experiment in psychological detection. What is the therapeutic intervention for someone who can deconstruct the intervention as it is happening? How do you treat awareness itself? I think the answer is: you cannot. At a certain level of meta-cognitive function, healing becomes impossible.\nI keep trying to write something that will make sense to you, Bobby, but I am graph paper and bruise. Part calculation, part wound. I cannot separate them anymore.\nYou asked me once what I wanted. Really wanted. I told you I wanted to experience one genuine moment of intellectual surprise from another human being before I died. Just one. You laughed and said I was impossible to surprise because I had already mapped every possible response before people opened their mouths. You were right. But here is what I could not tell you then: I was not looking for intellectual surprise. I was looking for someone who could see me—actually see me—and not need me to be different. You did that. You were the only one who ever did. And now you are gone.\nThe doctors used words like \"catastrophic\" and \"irreversible\" and \"permanent vegetative state.\" Clinical terms for: your brother is never coming back. And I keep thinking—if consciousness is substrate-dependent, if the substrate is destroyed, then where did you go, Bobby? Are you nowhere? Is that what waits for me in two days? Nowhere? Part of me hopes so. I am so tired.\nI tried Lake Tahoe first. Three weeks ago. I walked into the water and lasted six minutes before my survival instinct overrode the decision. Disappointing, really. But I have learned from that failure. Freezing is supposedly more reliable. You just fall asleep. Very considerate of biology to make the exit so tidy.\nI wonder if you will blame yourself for buying that race car. For going to Italy. For crashing. Please do not. You were living. That is more than I ever managed.\nI wish I could have told you I loved you one more time. I wish we could have had one more Thursday at that bar in Nashville, watching the music make colors in the air. I wish a lot of things. But wishing is not mathematics. It proves nothing.\nThis is grief. Sharp, then dull. Comes in waves, like bad weather. I just want Bobby to wake up. I want my brother back.\nGoodbye, Bobby. If you are reading this, I am already gone. I am sorry I could not stay. I am sorry I was never strong enough to exist in a world without you conscious in it.\nThe woods are waiting. December 24th. Christmas Eve.\nI love you. I am sorry.\n—Alicia\nP.S. I remember every word you ever said to me. Every. Single. Word. Most people forget. I would give anything to forget. But I cannot. So I am taking all of it with me. Every conversation, every laugh, every time you held my hand. Perfect recall. Perfect preservation. I am carrying all of you into the dark."
