            "text": "The corridor runs straight to a pair of double doors with wired glass panes and a red 'EXIT' sign above. Fluorescent troffers sit in a drop ceiling of off-white acoustic tiles, casting cool, even light. The walls are painted in a two-tone hospital scheme: pale mint on top, darker green on the lower half, separated by a crisp horizontal line. Doors line both sides, steel and painted to match the darker green, each with a narrow wired-glass vision panel and brushed metal kick plates. On the left wall, a cork-framed bulletin board hangs empty. Below it, a stainless-steel gurney with a flat green vinyl pad rests against the wall; its casters show grime and wear. On the right, an old cast-iron radiator runs a short length of the wall, paint slightly rough from age. Small wall plates and call buttons punctuate the corridor at regular intervals. The floor is beige VCT tile laid in a square grid, dull with age and marked by faint scuffs and cleaning swirls. The space is orderly, static, and silent; no personal items, no signage beyond the exit, no people. The materials, colors, and fixtures indicate institutional design from the mid-to-late twentieth century, preserved without recent renovation."
