            "text": "A small institutional room presents pale green walls and a beige vinyl tile floor with a square grid. A single metal-framed bed stands centered along the back wall, its tubular rails unpainted and dull. The mattress carries a muted striped cover; one flat white pillow rests near the headboard. Above, a rectangular fluorescent fixture runs parallel to the bed and provides even, cool light. Below the window sits a cast-iron radiator with exposed valves and feet. Next to the bed, a beige metal nightstand with a single drawer and cabinet door sits flush to the wall. The right wall holds a plain wood-veneer door with a metal latch plate. Dark base trim runs the perimeter of the room. The ceiling appears acoustic, divided into rectangular panels. The space is narrow and symmetrical."
