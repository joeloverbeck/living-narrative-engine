    "description": "Forward-pulling anticipation with restless momentum—the kind where attention can't stay put, keeps jutting toward what's next, and stillness itself feels like friction.",
    "actor_description": "There's a pull in my chest—forward, insistent, like I'm already halfway into the next moment. My thoughts won't stay here; they keep darting ahead, testing shapes, rehearsing. There's a live-wire hum under my skin, and sitting still feels like holding my breath for no reason. Not nerves—just this bright, restless wanting to be there already.",
    "description_text": "{actor} looks charged and forward-leaning—gaze drifting then sharpening, movements a touch quicker than necessary. They seem unable to fully settle, resetting posture as if waiting itself is uncomfortable, like they're already half a step ahead of themselves.",
