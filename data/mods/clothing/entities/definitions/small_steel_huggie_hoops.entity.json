A discreet hinge clicks securely into place, making them ideal for commuting to class or cooling down post-session. Their clean silver finish echoes the matte-black slides and red capsule tones without competing. Wear them with the ribbed cotton tank and longline sports bra when you want a refined accent that stays put through movement."
