The contoured footbed cradles arches after intense classes while the water-friendly finish makes poolside rinses effortless. Wide straps hug the foot without pinching, making them an easy partner for the mid-crew athletic socks between sessions. Slip them on after training to let the bike shorts and tank cool down in relaxed style."
