My chest tightens, breath going shallow and sharp. Thoughts narrow to one clear signal: stop, boundary, now. My body is already pulling back—freezing or bracing to push away—before I've even formed the words.",

Their attention snaps narrow and fixed, body language suddenly protective: arms crossing, distance created, contact refused. The shift is immediate and absolute, a boundary reasserted without negotiation.",
