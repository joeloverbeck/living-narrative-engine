      "text": "A slim duelist's rapier of exceptional elegance and theatrical flair. The swept-hilt guard is decorated with tiny silver charms that jingle softly with every movement, creating a subtle musical accompaniment to the blade's dance. The polished steel blade bears faint etchings of musical staff lines running its length, a testament to its owner's dual nature as both composer and duelist. The weapon feels perfectly balanced, designed for precise thrusts and graceful parries rather than brutal slashing—a blade for a performer of deadly artistry."
