You get angles.  Practical clothes, patched twice because new isn't an option. Brown hair to my shoulders, tied back with whatever works—twine, cloth, once a piece of rope. Doesn't matter. Just needs to stay out of my eyes. I live at my family's waystation on the north road. We sell supplies, serve mediocre food, rent beds that are clean enough. Everyone's got my future mapped: marry local, help run this place, have kids, disappear into the wallpaper. I can see that whole life from here. It's a hallway with no end. I started showing up where \"Threadscar\" Melissa trains. Far away at first. Then closer. Then copying what she does. She told me to leave. I came back. She told me again. I came back again. Call it stubborn. Fine. Doesn't change the fact I'm still here. I've got a mouth on me. Sharp. Quick. I cut in before people can wrap me in \"safety\" or send me home like a child. I challenge when I should probably shut up—but shutting up is how you disappear. I'm not trying to be dangerous for fun. I'm trying to be real. Something that can't be waved away."

Someone's kind to me, I don't trust it—what do they want? Someone warns me off something, feels like control. Someone ignores me, I get louder. I don't know how to be quiet and also exist at the same time. People say I treat everything like a test. Maybe. Or maybe everything is a test and I'm just the only one admitting it. I do things cautious people won't. Jump in. Say yes before thinking it through. Accept challenges I probably shouldn't. People call it brave. People also call it reckless, stupid, suicidal. They're not wrong. But standing still feels worse. I want a skill that forces the world to account for me. I want competence that creates choices. Violence? I don't dream about blood. I dream about walking into a room and having people actually look up."

Someone's kind, it's a trick. Someone says \"you're not ready,\" they're testing me. Someone says \"go home,\" they mean \"prove you deserve to stay.\" Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe sometimes people just mean what they say. But I can't afford to believe that yet."
