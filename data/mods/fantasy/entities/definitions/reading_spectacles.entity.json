Designed specifically for tortoise-person anatomy, they perch with scholarly precision atop a pronounced beak rather than resting on ears. The lenses are sized for close work—perfect for deciphering faded ink on century-old documents. Through these unassuming circles of glass, bureaucratic details become crystal clear, allowing their wearer to maintain exacting standards of archival accuracy for decades on end."
