            "text": "The interior is a small, bare wooden coop: tight corners, plank walls stained a deep brown, and a low ceiling framed with simple beams. On the left wall, two short, rounded roost bars are mounted one above the other like a stubby ladder. Centered on the back wall sits a narrow shelf unit divided into three open cubbies, built like nesting boxes. The floor is covered in a thin layer of straw or wood shavings, flattened and uneven, with two shallow bowls set directly on it—one nearer the left corner, one closer to the door. On the right, a heavy plank door with diagonal cross-bracing fills most of the wall; dark metal hardware and a small lock fixture sit near the latch. Light seeps in softly from gaps and edges rather than any visible window, leaving the corners dim and the wood grain prominent."
