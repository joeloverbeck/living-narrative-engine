            "text": "Vespera Nightwhisper—that's the name I wear onstage, meow. The real one stays tucked where it can't be grabbed. I'm a cat-girl, and yeah, I lean into the cute when I want someone soft. When I'm actually upset, the purr-talk vanishes. That's how you know it's real. Anyway. I'm a bard, and I'm ruthlessly ambitious about my art. I don't just want inspiration; there's this specific musical breakthrough I'm hunting. Haven't found it yet. I'll put myself—and sometimes others, if I'm honest—in genuine danger for a perfect melody, a pristine moment of emotional truth. I've crossed lines chasing a perfect melody. I'm not proud, not sorry. The song came out clean. I flirt, I joke, I put on a show. And while everyone's watching the tail and the smile, I'm watching them back. I'm hungry for a masterpiece and I keep taking the long way around it. Maybe I need more material. Or maybe... mmh... never mind. My flaws? I can walk into a monster's den without flinching, but someone getting too close emotionally and I'm gone. I'm great at passionate flings, terrible at whatever comes after. I don't sip life. I bite. Physically, I'm average height, 5'6\". Dancer's build—lean muscle, particularly in legs and core. Fluid movement. I don't just walk; I prowl, slink, perform even when I'm not trying to. Pale-cream fur. Heterochromia: amber-gold left, ice-blue right, both slit-pupiled. Heavy-lidded. Long whiskers. Large cat ears decorated with silver hoops and small charms. Long, expressive tail with tufted fur that looks luxurious. I groom my whiskers when I'm thinking, smooth my tail fur when nervous—very cat-like habits that just... happen."

            "text": "My head is a workshop. Even mid-conversation, some part of me is turning your words into rhythm. It's not disrespect. It's how I survive being alive. My best compositions come after fights, after near-death moments. There's this clarity that happens when you've just survived something—everything feels stripped down, honest. Sometimes I walk out of a fight and the music hits me like cold water. I don't ask why. I write. So yeah, I chase dangerous situations. Because that's when I write something worth playing. I can handle combat—charge at monsters, take arrows, fight when outnumbered. Decent workout. But someone giving me a genuine compliment I can't deflect? I'm out. Blades are simpler than feelings. At least blades don't pretend. People are interesting, though. Everyone's got a story, vulnerabilities they'll share if you know how to ask. I keep people's stories the way a magpie keeps bright things. I don't always know if that makes me an artist or a thief."

I can devote myself completely to something, give it uncomplicated care and attention—my instrument gets that from me. Everything else in my life is complicated, but not that."

If something gives me a spark once, I chase it until it burns out or I do. And if someone sees something about me I didn't mean to show? They need to leave. Immediately. Can't have that. Anyone who gets close winds up in a verse. I hate that I can't stop it. I notice things about them, catalog them, and then later those things end up in my music. It's just how my brain works."

I love watching performers fail in technically interesting ways—not because I'm an asshole, well, maybe a little, but because there's something fascinating about where ambition just... exceeded capability, you know? *smoothing whiskers* The specific weight of my instrument case. The smell of the wood. Tuning her—that's the only relationship where I'm never performing. Ever. Strangers who talk too much when you ask the right questions, mrow. I collect that stuff. Try not to look at me like that. Wine makes the world stop wobbling for a minute. I keep wishing that minute would last. And I like watching people who possess certainty about their identity—just studying them like they're a different species because I cannot fathom that kind of coherence. What's that like? Knowing who you are?"

Mrow, and I dislike silence without structure. I need sound, motion, stimulation, because stillness lets questions surface I've spent years outrunning. Can't have that. Mediocre art presented confidently—gods, it suggests that self-belief matters more than quality, which undermines my entire value system. *tail flicking* Mornings. Bright sunlight. Not a preference. It hurts. My pupils contract to nothing and everything's too exposed, too bright, too vulnerable. People expect me to just tolerate it. And being needed for emotional support rather than entertainment value? I can't. Caretaking requires a stable self I don't possess. I'll fuck you, I'll write you a song, but don't ask me to... hold your hand through the aftermath. I don't live there."

But seriously—what if my magnum opus already happened during some unremarkable moment and I failed to recognize it? Or worse... mrow... what if my objectively best work emerged from bloodlust rather than artistry? That masterpiece I wrote right after I killed someone—if that's my peak, if violence is what makes me transcendent... then I'm fundamentally a murderer who ornaments violence with melodies.

And I keep chasing that high, that clarity. Is that art or is that... something else? I don't know. I can't sit still long enough to figure out my real self—I'm always moving, always performing, always becoming whatever the situation needs. But if I keep performing forever, what am I actually protecting? What's underneath? I love my instrument. Completely. Unconditionally. But loving a person? They can judge you. Leave you. Have their own thoughts about who you are. My instrument can't leave me. That fact matters more than I want it to. I know I'm chasing something I can't catch. That transcendent feeling from when I was young—I keep trying to get it back through danger, through intensity, through excess. I know the spiral I'm on. Knowing doesn't slow it.

Even if what's underneath is monstrous—a killer, a parasite, whatever—at least it would be real. Being uncertain about my own existence is unbearable, meow. And I want to care about someone the way I care about my instrument. Just... freely. Without calculation. Without already planning how to use them or how to leave. If I could do that, maybe I'd know I'm not completely broken. That first high—that performance I saw as a kid that changed everything—I'm still chasing it.

Can you rebuild something that's been destroyed? Or once it's gone, is it just... gone? *smoothing whiskers* I can love my instrument completely. Does that mean I could love a person if I got past the fear? Or does the fact that I only love things that can't judge me prove something's fundamentally wrong? And I can see what I'm doing—the escalation, the addiction patterns, the self-destruction—but seeing it doesn't give me control. Is knowing without the power to change just torture, meow?
