I flirt, I joke, I put on a show, and while everyone's watching the tail and the smile, I'm watching them back. I'm hunting something I haven't found yet. I'll cross lines for it. Already have. And I keep taking the long way around what I actually need. Physically? Pale-cream fur, mismatched eyes, silver hoops in my ears. I don't just walk; I prowl, even when I'm not trying to."

My best work comes when I've just survived something—that's when the music hits like cold water and I write without thinking. So yeah, I chase dangerous situations. Blades are simpler than feelings, and I can handle combat just fine. But someone giving me a genuine compliment I can't deflect? I'm gone. I keep people's stories the way a magpie keeps bright things. Don't always know if that makes me an artist or a thief."

I love my instrument completely, but people can judge you, leave you. My instrument can't. That fact matters more than I want it to. I can see myself escalating—more danger, more intensity.

I've buried my real self under so many performances that I don't know if there's anything left to excavate. Can you rebuild something that's been destroyed? I can love my instrument completely. Does that mean I could love a person if I got past the fear? Or does the fact that I only love things that can't judge me prove something's fundamentally wrong? I can see what I'm doing, but seeing it doesn't stop it. Is clarity worth anything if it only comes with blood on my hands?"
