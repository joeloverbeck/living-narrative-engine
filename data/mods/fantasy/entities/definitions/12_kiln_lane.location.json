            "text": "A small timber-framed cottage sits snug against a cobbled lane, its steep red-tiled roof glowing warm under a bright, hazy sky. Dark beams crisscross pale plaster walls, and a squat stone chimney rises from the ridge like a blunt thumbprint of industry. The building is modest in footprint but loudly purposeful: clay jugs and stout earthenware pots line the sill, the lintel, and a rough shelf beneath the upper window, staged like proof of skill rather than decoration. A hanging sign creaks from an iron bracket by the door—painted with a simple pot emblem and the blunt word POTTERY—marking the place as a working shop, not just a home. More finished vessels cluster at the threshold and along the front wall, their rounded bellies catching soft light, their warm terracotta color echoing the roof tiles above. The doorway itself is shadowed, a dark mouth that suggests cool interior air and the faint promise of kiln heat deeper within. To the right, a low wooden fence hems in a patch of grass where several chickens wander and peck, scattered casually across the yard like restless punctuation. Green shrubs press close to the house, and tall trees blur into a leafy backdrop, giving the whole scene a tucked-away feeling."
