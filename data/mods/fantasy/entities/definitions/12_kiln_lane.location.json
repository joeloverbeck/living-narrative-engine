      "text": "An old, low house sits alone at the edge of a dirt path, its thick thatched roof drooping slightly with age. A stone foundation lifts the walls just enough to show how long the building has been standing, while the pale plaster above it is worn and uneven, patched and cracked in hairline runs that catch the light. The front is plain and practical: a heavy wooden door set deep in its frame, flanked by small, square windows with dark panes. Nothing is ornamental, but everything looks kept—maintained in the way a working home is maintained, by habit and necessity rather than pride. Near the door, a small stone platform holds a cluster of terracotta jars, their rounded shoulders and rough surfaces echoing the earth tones of the house itself. Around it, grass and trees press in close, softening the hard lines of stone and timber. The whole place feels quietly sealed off—simple, sturdy, and watchful."
