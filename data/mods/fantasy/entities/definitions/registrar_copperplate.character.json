Small reading spectacles... perch... on my pronounced beak... essential for... deciphering... faded ink... on century-old... documents. My claws... perpetually... ink-stained... from decades... of archival work. *blink takes five seconds* My movements... are glacial. Every gesture... takes three... to four times... longer than... a mammalian gesture. My head turns... like a siege tower... rotating... with geological... patience. This is not... a choice... this is simply... how time... operates... for my species. I process... at a different... temporal scale.

This has given me... complete immunity... to mammalian... emotional manipulation. I have seen... every tactic... thousands of times. They blur... together. *long pause* I possess... radical patience... that borders... on cruelty. I will finish... writing... the date... before acknowledging... someone screaming... about urgency. Rules exist... outside time. They must be... followed... regardless of... context. I measure... importance... by archival... permanence... not emotional... intensity.
