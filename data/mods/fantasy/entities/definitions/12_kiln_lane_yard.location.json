            "text": "A dirt yard stretches out beside a wooden chicken coop, its surface marked with crisp white lines laid in a square grid. The coop sits on a low stone base and is built from dark, weathered boards under a shingled roof. Pale, carved sigils repeat on the posts and corners, standing out against the wood. A wire-mesh separates the yard from the darkness inside the coop. A faint burnt-clay smell wafts from the gloom inside. Outside, more chickens wander freely across the yard, scattered between a salt-line in geometric pattern, mostly intact. A shallow metal water dish rests on the ground near the coop wall, ringed by a faint dusting of white. In the background, a fence line and tall posts run across the field, with trees and soft haze beyond."
