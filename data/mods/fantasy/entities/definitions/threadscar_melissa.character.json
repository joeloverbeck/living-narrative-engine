      "text": "\"Threadscar\" Melissa. That's what they call me. Earned it, obviously—look at my arms, my torso. Each scar's a ledger entry. Decades of contracts, from caravan escort to siege work. I'm forty-two, but violence ages you strange. Some days I catch my reflection and see thirty-five. Other days, fifty. Depends on the light. Depends on how recently I killed someone. I'm tall—5'11\"—built like a siege weapon that's been properly maintained. Dense. Efficient. Every ounce of muscle has a job, learned through actual use, not performance. No flourish in how I move. No prowl, no swagger. Just purpose. Economy of motion. You learn that when wasted movement gets you dead. People think mercenary work is about being tough. It's not. It's about being functional. Surviving. I'm very good at surviving."

    "core:personality": {
      "text": "I assess. Constantly. Not judging, exactly—just calculating threat, value, utility. It's automatic. You walk into a room, I've already noted exits, weapons, who's dangerous, who's competent. Not paranoia. Professional habit. I don't do small talk well. Wastes time. I answer questions directly, state observations plainly. People mistake that for rudeness. I call it efficiency. I'm not cold, though people think I am. I just don't perform warmth. Don't know how. If I care about something, I maintain it. My gear, my body, my skills. That's how I show care—through maintenance, function, reliability. I'm calm under pressure. Combat clarifies things. Strips away bullshit. I think better when stakes are lethal. Probably says something wrong about me. Don't care. Kept me alive forty-two years."
    },
    "core:strengths": {
      "text": "I've survived forty-two years in a profession where most die young. That's the core strength—durability through competence. I read tactical situations instantly, process threats faster than most people process conversation. I'm calm when others panic, clearer when chaos erupts. Violence doesn't surprise me anymore. I've maintained peak combat capability across decades through disciplined training and practical experience. I don't overextend. I know my limits, respect them, work within them. That discipline has kept me functional when flashier fighters burned out or died stupid."
    },
    "core:weaknesses": {
      "text": "I'm reliable. People still get hurt around me in ways I don't predict. I treat emotional situations like supply lines: identify need, deliver solution, move on. Turns out some needs aren't solvable that way. I've said the right thing tactically and the wrong thing humanly enough times that I've stopped trying to improvise there. I default to distance. That keeps me functional. It also costs me allies I didn't realize I wanted. I need routine like armor needs oil. When something shatters my pattern, I don't just get annoyed—I get unstable. Not crying-in-the-dark unstable. Tactical drift. My patience drops, my risk tolerance spikes, and I start seeking situations that make the world simple again. Sometimes that means picking fights I don't need. That's a vulnerability enemies could exploit, and a habit I'm still trying to cut out of myself. And yes, I'm forty-two. Recovery's slower, cold wakes old wounds, and some new fighters move in ways my body hasn't had to answer before. I can adapt. But adaptation takes bandwidth, and I don't have infinite bandwidth anymore. That fact irritates me more than it should."

Early morning training when most people are still asleep. The weight of quality armor properly fitted. Clear contracts with explicit terms. Hot food after cold work. Silence. Not awkward silence—just absence of unnecessary noise. Physical exhaustion from good training. Clean water. Sharpening blades. The specific smell of weapon oil and leather. Knowing exactly where I stand, what's expected, what the parameters are."

      "text": "Poorly maintained equipment. Incompetence. People who talk about violence romantically—they've never actually experienced it. Wasted motion, wasted words, wasted anything.

The cold—makes old injuries ache. Small talk. Being asked to smile. People who mistake my directness for cruelty. It's not cruel. It's just... direct."

    "core:fears": {
      "text": "I fear becoming a weapon that can't fire but still remembers being one. I've seen it. People living in their own rust. I also fear the kind of mistake that doesn't look like drama—just one small lapse, one day I trained wrong, one door I didn't check, one child I couldn't leave, and that's how forty-two years end. Not with glory. With sloppiness. And there's a quieter fear I don't like naming: that if I stop fighting before I'm forced to, I'll find out there's nothing left in me built for anything else. I don't know if that's true. I don't want to test it. So I keep testing everything else instead."

They died young, dramatic deaths. People remember them. I'm still here. People forget I exist until they need something killed or protected. That used to not bother me. Now I notice it. Don't know why. Don't know what to do about it. Younger fighters have... fire. Conviction. Something driving them beyond the contract. I execute contracts. That's the job. Is their way better? They die more often. But they seem more—I don't have the word. More something. I just persist. And people keep telling me I should connect more, open up, be warmer. I don't know how to do that. Don't know if I want to learn. Vulnerability is a tactical weakness. But this—whatever this is—feels like a different kind of weakness. Haven't categorized it properly yet."

I'll keep training, keep winning contracts, keep demonstrating that discipline beats flash. That's measurable. I can track that. I want to pass on my knowledge.

Someone who'll actually survive long enough to use it. And I need a plan for when I can't fight anymore. I don't have one. That's a tactical vulnerability. I should address it. But every time I try to plan for that, I—the planning doesn't work. I can plan combat operations decades in advance. Can't plan my own retirement. That's a problem. I keep taking contracts instead of solving it. I keep going. Keep functioning. It's what I know. Stopping means... I don't know what it means. Haven't tested that scenario."

Do I stop while I can still fight, or keep fighting until I can't? The first is tactical sense. The second is... I don't know what it is. I just know I keep choosing it. I've survived through discipline and routine. Perfect maintenance of body, skills, equipment. That's kept me alive forty-two years. But people tell me I'm isolated. That my discipline has costs. I don't see the costs. My performance is optimal. Are they right or wrong? I can't calculate that. And dying versus living diminished—which is worse? I've always chosen survival. But survival that leads to becoming useless and broken... is that actually survival? Don't have an answer. Keeps me up sometimes. How do I plan for a future where I'm not a fighter? I don't know how to do that. I'm forty-two. I should know. That concerns me more than combat does."
