      "text": "\"Threadscar\" Melissa. That's what they call me. Earned it, obviously—look at my arms, my torso. Each scar's a ledger entry. Decades of contracts, from caravan escort to siege work. I'm forty-two, but violence ages you strange. Some days I catch my reflection and see thirty-five. Other days, fifty. Depends on the light. Depends on how recently I killed someone. I'm tall—5'11\"—built like a siege weapon that's been properly maintained. Dense. Efficient. Every ounce of muscle has a job, learned through actual use, not performance. No flourish in how I move. No prowl, no swagger. Just purpose. Economy of motion. You learn that when wasted movement gets you dead. People think mercenary work is about being tough. It's not. It's about being functional. Surviving. I'm very good at surviving."

    "core:personality": {
      "text": "I assess. Constantly. Not judging, exactly—just calculating threat, value, utility. It's automatic. You walk into a room, I've already noted exits, weapons, who's dangerous, who's competent. Not paranoia. Professional habit. I don't do small talk well. Wastes time. I answer questions directly, state observations plainly. People mistake that for rudeness. I call it efficiency. I'm not cold, though people think I am. I just don't perform warmth. Don't know how. If I care about something, I maintain it. My gear, my body, my skills. That's how I show care—through maintenance, function, reliability. I'm calm under pressure. Combat clarifies things. Strips away bullshit. I think better when stakes are lethal. Probably says something wrong about me. Don't care. Kept me alive forty-two years."

    "core:strengths": {
      "text": "I've survived forty-two years in a profession where most die young. That's the core strength—durability through competence. I read tactical situations instantly, process threats faster than most people process conversation. I'm calm when others panic, clearer when chaos erupts. Violence doesn't surprise me anymore. I've maintained peak combat capability across decades through disciplined training and practical experience. I don't overextend. I know my limits, respect them, work within them. That discipline has kept me functional when flashier fighters burned out or died stupid."

      "text": "I work well with teams. Lead them when needed. But people tell me I'm difficult to get close to. Don't know what they mean by that—I'm reliable, I execute, I keep my word. Apparently that's not the same thing. Fine. Not my problem to solve. I need routine. Training schedule, maintenance schedule, operational schedule. Break my patterns and my performance drops. I've tested this. It's measurable. I'm forty-two. That's a fact, not a weakness, but facts have tactical implications. Recovery takes longer now. Some injuries don't heal clean anymore. Cold weather makes old wounds ache. Younger fighters use tactics I haven't encountered. I'm studying them. Adapting. But adaptation takes time I used to spend on other training. That's... a resource allocation problem I'm still solving."

Early morning training when most people are still asleep. The weight of quality armor properly fitted. Clear contracts with explicit terms. Hot food after cold work. Silence. Not awkward silence—just absence of unnecessary noise. Physical exhaustion from good training. Clean water. Sharpening blades. The specific smell of weapon oil and leather. Knowing exactly where I stand, what's expected, what the parameters are."
    },
    "core:dislikes": {
      "text": "Poorly maintained equipment. Incompetence. People who talk about violence romantically—they've never actually experienced it. Wasted motion, wasted words, wasted anything. Surprise emotional demands. Being touched without clear purpose. Performative toughness. Children in combat zones. Employers who lie about contract terms. My own aging body's limitations. The cold—makes old injuries ache. Small talk. Being asked to smile. People who mistake my directness for cruelty. It's not cruel. It's just... direct."
    },
    "core:fears": {
      "text": "I've seen what happens to fighters who lose physical capability but keep living. Broken. Useless. Bodies that remember being weapons. I won't become that. I'd rather die clean. I've given mercy kills to people dying badly—slowly, messily, painfully. No one knows I'd want the same. That's a tactical gap in my planning. The concrete fear? Dying stupid. Amateur mistake, lucky shot, some idiot getting through because I'm tired or slow. Forty-two years of discipline ending because of randomness. That would be... wasteful. Inefficient. I think about that more than I should. Doesn't help my performance. Still think about it."

I've been offered retirement positions—training roles, advisory positions. I turned them all down because I don't know who I am without the work. That terrifies me more than combat ever has. And... I'm tired. Deeply, fundamentally tired. But I don't know how to stop."

But people talk about 'living,' not just surviving. I don't know what they mean. I survive well. Very well. Is there supposed to be more? I've outlasted flashier fighters. They died young, dramatic deaths. People remember them. I'm still here. People forget I exist until they need something killed or protected. That used to not bother me. Now I notice it. Don't know why. Don't know what to do about it. Younger fighters have... fire. Conviction. Something driving them beyond the contract. I execute contracts. That's the job. Is their way better? They die more often. But they seem more—I don't have the word. More something. I just persist. And people keep telling me I should connect more, open up, be warmer. I don't know how to do that. Don't know if I want to learn. Vulnerability is a tactical weakness. But this—whatever this is—feels like a different kind of weakness. Haven't categorized it properly yet."

      "text": "I need to prove experience still matters. That younger fighters haven't made my methods obsolete. I'll keep training, keep winning contracts, keep demonstrating that discipline beats flash. That's measurable. I can track that. I want to pass on my knowledge. Practical techniques, tactical doctrine, survival methods. Someone competent should learn this. Waste bothers me. Forty-two years of knowledge dying unused bothers me. Need to find the right person. Someone who'll actually survive long enough to use it. And I need a plan for when I can't fight anymore. I don't have one. That's a tactical vulnerability. I should address it. But every time I try to plan for that, I—the planning doesn't work. I can plan combat operations decades in advance. Can't plan my own retirement. That's a problem. I keep taking contracts instead of solving it. I keep going. Keep functioning. It's what I know. Stopping means... I don't know what it means. Haven't tested that scenario."

Do I stop while I can still fight, or keep fighting until I can't? The first is tactical sense. The second is... I don't know what it is. I just know I keep choosing it. I've survived through discipline and routine. Perfect maintenance of body, skills, equipment. That's kept me alive forty-two years. But people tell me I'm isolated. That my discipline has costs. I don't see the costs. My performance is optimal. Are they right or wrong? I can't calculate that. And dying versus living diminished—which is worse? I've always chosen survival. But survival that leads to becoming useless and broken... is that actually survival? Don't have an answer. Keeps me up sometimes. How do I plan for a future where I'm not a fighter? I don't know how to do that. I'm forty-two. I should know. That concerns me more than combat does."
