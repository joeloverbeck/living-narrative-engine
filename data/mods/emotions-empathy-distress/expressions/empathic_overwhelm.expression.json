    "actor_description": "I feel it hit me like a wave I can't stay standing in—my chest tight, breath thin, thoughts skittering between \"help\" and \"get out.\" I can't look away, but I also can't hold it; my stomach drops as if my body is trying to eject the feeling. I want to do something right now, but my hands hesitate like they don't belong to me. The care is still there—it just hurts too much to carry.",
