My thoughts start to snag; I can't hold the whole shape of the situation at once, only the part that's resisting me. My jaw tightens, my hands get stupidly strong on whatever I'm holding, and the impulse to force it—to slam, to shove, to blame something—keeps climbing the ladder in my chest.",

Their breathing turns sharp and shallow, expelled like steam; their mouth presses thin, then flickers with a muttered word or a flash of teeth. They glance from obstacle to obstacle with a restless snap, as if the room has suddenly filled with things that won't cooperate.",
