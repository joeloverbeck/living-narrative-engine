    "actor_description": "The anger comes with a sting in it—like a bruise you didn’t know you had until someone pressed it. Part of me wants to lash out, but the sharper part is the hurt: the sense that I mattered, that we were connected, and that something just got handled carelessly. My chest feels tight. My throat feels crowded. I can feel myself wanting to say something harsh and immediately regrettable, because harshness is a way to stop the bleeding. I look at them and I’m angry, yes—but I’m also watching for any sign they understand what they did. I’m still oriented toward them. I still care. That’s the problem. My words come out edged and shaky: accusations that are half boundary, half plea. I’m trying to protect myself without admitting how much it hit.",
    "description_text": "{actor}'s anger shows up with visible strain—eyes bright with tension, mouth set too hard, voice sharp in a way that can’t quite hide the hurt underneath. They stay oriented toward the person who caused it, not away: the posture is confrontational but connected, as if they’re demanding recognition rather than seeking destruction. The hostility flickers with vulnerability—an accusation that feels like a wounded reach for repair.",
    "alternate_descriptions": {
        "auditory": "I hear a voice catch at the edges—sharp consonants with a tremor beneath them. The rhythm suggests restraint failing in small bursts: a hard question, a tight pause, a quieter admission buried inside anger.",
        "tactile": "The air feels raw—like there's exposed nerve in the room. It's anger with tenderness still attached, making every word feel more personal and more risky."
