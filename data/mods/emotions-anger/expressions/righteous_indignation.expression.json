    "description": "Righteous indignation—anger that stays human. The mind gets sharp and moralizing; attention locks onto “this is wrong” with a heat that feels energizing rather than purely destructive. It carries urgency and care (not cold contempt), and it resists sliding into dehumanizing hatred or uncontrolled rage.",
    "category": "anger",
    "actor_description": "Something in me snaps into judgment—clear, hot, and unignorable. My thoughts start forming clean lines: right, wrong, unacceptable, and I feel a need to push back out loud. It isn’t blind fury; it’s focused anger with a pulse of care underneath it, like my values just stood up inside my chest.",
    "description_text": "{actor} bristles with controlled heat—eyes bright, voice edged, posture forward as if ready to argue the point. Their anger reads principled and urgent, more “call it out” than “tear it down.”",
