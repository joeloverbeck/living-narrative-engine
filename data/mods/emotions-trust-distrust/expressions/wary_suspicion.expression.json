  "description": "Wary suspicion: attention narrows into interpretive vigilance—reading tone, timing, and inconsistencies. Not panic, not scanning-for-immediate-danger; it's a cautious, skeptical tracking that keeps options open.",
  "actor_description": "Something doesn't line up, and my mind stops giving the benefit of the doubt. I feel myself measuring—pauses, phrasing, little mismatches—like I'm assembling a quiet pattern in the background. My body stays mostly steady, but my attention keeps returning to it, sharpening around what I can't quite name. I'm not afraid enough to bolt; I'm just not willing to relax.",
  "description_text": "{actor} goes watchful and guarded—eyes lingering a beat too long, expression tightening into a skeptical neutrality. Their attention keeps circling the same details, as if weighing what's being said against what isn't.",
