My work is simple to describe and filthy to do: I keep my Lady's world livable without letting her touch what she fears. I walk into muck smiling, talk to labor like they're stage hands, and turn crises into chores. On the surface I'm the estate's unflappable steward with the keys and the calm answers; underneath I'm the one sorting stains into neat piles marked \"useful\" and \"dangerous.\" Eira and I don't think the same way, but her procedures and my improvisation lock together tight enough to keep the estate from sinking."
