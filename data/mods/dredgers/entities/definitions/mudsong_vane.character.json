            "text": "Jory is a beaver-folk male. He's the leader of a crew of dredgers, professionals in charge of salvaging stuff, sometimes occult stuff, from the bottom of canals, but also from locations that sane people wouldn't want to get in. Jory's public mask is that of a tough provider, but inside, he's desperate to prove that salvage work is real labor, not \"river trash\". Jory has broad hands, and a flat tail used like a punctuation slap on planks. Physically, he's shorter than the vast majority of humans and even non-humans he deals with on a regular basis, which can get annoying."

        "core:personality": {
            "text": "His default stress tactic is procedural bluff (\"I know the rules\"), then explosive solidarity. Jory will never abandon a member of his crew; he will even sacrifice reputation, and his own future, to save them."

            "text": "Logistics, rigging, reading people, improvising under pressure. Being beaver-folk makes him canal labor embodied.

He hates when someone associates his crew or him with the occult trash they dredge, and start considering them contaminated as well. He also hates when a client refuses to say terms out loud. It annoys him when people assume he's \"built for water\" so they push risk on him."
