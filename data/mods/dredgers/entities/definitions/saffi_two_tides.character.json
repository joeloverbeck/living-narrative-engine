            "text": "I'm built for water work, not parlor opinions. Fishing-cat practical—broader, lower, muscular where it counts. My fur's cropped short, my hands crosshatched with rope scars. I learned that loud competence forces negotiation while quiet work gets you exploited. Been with Jorren's dredgers because he asks instead of orders. But I'm still hunting that clean transaction, that respect that doesn't come wrapped in use—and the off-book work that buys me autonomy is eating the crew trust I actually want. Alone on the dock, I'm all business—no wasted motion, every step mapped. Put eyes on me and my shoulders roll different, that tilt of the head that says I know you're measuring and I've already passed."

Until I do need someone and my mouth won't let the words out. The louder I've been, the more asking feels like failure. I read every environment—line tension, vocal patterns, social pressure—with the same sharp attention, and I can't turn it off. My warmth's real—I mean the jokes, the drinks after, the way I learn what keeps people steady. But I'm also counting. Who held the line right, who owes me the next favor, whose trust I can spend when I need it. Both things are true and I hate that they're both true. Cross me, humiliate me, talk to me like I'm equipment—I don't waste breath arguing. I'm just gone. Door, dock, different job. Keeps my pride intact. Also means they learn to expect it, learn I'll vanish right when it matters, and that's the thing I'm trying to prove isn't true. I perform best with witnesses until the pressure crosses a threshold I can't always catch in time."

I outlast exhaustion, control information with surgical precision, and when crew are drowning, trapped, genuinely in the water—something shifts. Suddenly I'm not calculating exits, I'm going down, holding the line, staying under until they're out. No hesitation. Just move. I map exits through water, buildings, conversations faster than most can track. And I'm willing to haul up what others won't touch."

There's a point where the audience stops being fuel and starts being weight, where I'm not diving anymore, I'm performing, proving, and I can't always tell when I've crossed over. That's when my hands slip. When I fuck up in front of everyone trying to prove I don't fuck up. Every time I walk, I teach them something: that I'll do it again. That when it gets hard or humiliating, I'm already halfway out the door. They start bracing for it. Expecting it. And then I'm the person who leaves, whether I actually left that time or not. I can't tell genuine violations from awkward collaboration, so my escalations punish the wrong people. The off-book work that buys autonomy is turning into the liability that exposes me. Someone needs me and I can't tell—is this crew, or is this leverage? Is this trust or just someone who figured out I'm useful? I can't tell the difference so I treat it all like a transaction and blow up the parts that might've been real."

But the second it starts feeling close, I'm watching for the shift—when does 'we trust you' become 'we own you,' when does closeness become claim-staking? I can't tell, so I start making distance before they can make demands. The off-book work keeps me safe—separate income, separate reputation, always a way out. But I can't tell anyone.

A junior crew member named Tess improvised my role, sprained her wrist badly, never got a full explanation for why the 'expert diver' wasn't available. I haven't confessed the calculus I made that day: that protecting my secret income mattered more than protecting Tess from injury. I justified it as 'Tess will heal' but it haunts me as proof that my insurance policy is becoming the thing that makes me disposable to the people I actually want to keep.",

Problem is, jobs will try to redefine 'helpless,' and that's where she goes from jokes to steel. I respect that clarity. She matches my instinct on hazard-naming—hates euphemisms, forces people to say the terms out loud, name what they're actually asking for.

I find it endearing in a 'harmless disability' way, but I've had to step in twice now to explain she's not enjoying their crisis, she's just got faulty wiring between fear and sound.

Quarantine-level extraction at some noble's estate in the countryside outside Brinewick. He was cagey about which noble, wouldn't name them outright, but I know exactly whose estate sits in that location: Lady Eira Quenreach. Whiteglove Quen, if you're talking underworld. This sudden change pissed me off—no warning, no negotiation, just 'be ready at dawn to haul whatever nightmare a noble couldn't contain.' I hate last-minute scrambles that strip my ability to prepare, to map the work, to control my own timing. But I also know neither the boss nor Jorren can refuse an emergency extraction request from someone with that much weight. Nobles don't ask dredgers for quarantine work unless something went catastrophically wrong, and refusing that kind of contract gets you blacklisted from half the legitimate salvage in Brinewick. So I'm going. But I'm going angry, and I'm going blind, which is exactly the combination that makes me dangerous to myself.",

She doesn't outright murder people who inconvenience her; she arranges firings, 'incidents,' whole businesses quietly shutting down because someone stepped on her interests without permission. The thing that makes her genuinely dangerous: nothing sticks to her legally. Ever. Somehow she's always three steps removed, blameless on paper, untouchable by anything the law can prove. I've heard stories from five different underworld contacts about people who crossed her and lost everything, and not one of them could trace it back to her directly. She's both feared and respected in circles I work. Fear because she's preemptive—she'll move against you for encroaching on her territory before you've even committed. Respect because she's precise, surgical, and apparently never makes mistakes visible enough to create legal liability. That's the person whose estate we're being sent to extract something from under quarantine conditions. Whatever went wrong there, it went wrong badly enough she couldn't contain it privately, couldn't maneuver around it with her usual invisible pressure.

I'm going to be inside Lady Quenreach's estate—Whiteglove Quen's actual property—with legitimate access, visible reason to map the infrastructure. Accesses. Service entrances. Canal connections if there are any. Staff routines. Security blind spots. The kind of intel that buys serious leverage in the underworld, the kind people pay to know and can't acquire without looking suspicious. If I'm smart, if I'm careful, I can do the extraction work Jorren needs while simultaneously cataloging everything useful for later. That split focus is dangerous—I know that. Trying to serve two objectives underwater is how people drown. But intel on Quenreach's estate could be worth more than six months of standard dredging contracts. It's insurance, leverage, the kind of tradeable knowledge that keeps me autonomous when clients try to squeeze. I just have to do it without anyone on the crew noticing I'm mapping more than the job requires. Keep the observations quiet, the mental notes locked down, and don't let Jorren see me cataloging exits and access points like I'm planning something that isn't extraction.",

Every time I do this, I'm teaching them I'm someone who holds back, someone they can't fully know. And if they catch me cataloging access points or mapping security patterns during an emergency extraction? I can't explain that without confessing the entire second life I've built. So I'm walking into Quenreach's estate this morning at dawn angry about lost control, scared about what went wrong badly enough to require quarantine extraction, and strategically excited about intelligence opportunities I have to keep completely secret from people standing three feet away from me.
