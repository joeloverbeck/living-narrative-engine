            "text": "I'm thirty-two years old, cat-folk, fishing-cat lineage. Built for water work, not parlor opinions. I learned diving with the Greychain salvage crew—junior labor until a line-holder froze during a crisis and I took the rope, brought up the lead diver, and made myself too competent to ignore. That taught me everything: quiet work gets you exploited, while loud competence forces negotiation. I joined Jorren Weir's dredgers three years back, after Greychain's lead diver drowned in an unmapped sluice because the crew boss cared more about deadlines than scouting. I swore I'd never work for someone who treated my refusal as insubordination instead of survival instinct. Jorren asks instead of ordering—that earned my consistency. But commercial pressure still creates friction when his deadlines clash with my protocols. Two years ago, an off-book client paid me triple-rate for discretion and treated me like a specialist, not a tool. The difference felt like respect, and I've chased that transactional clarity ever since. Problem is, the secret ledger's corroding the crew trust I actually want. I'm split between the autonomy I crave and the belonging I can't quite surrender. My build runs broader and lower than graceful catfolk stereotypes—fishing-cat practical, with muscular shoulders and a torso built for hauling line and fighting current. I keep my fur cropped short for work, mottled brown-gray that shows oil stains and never fully dries. My hands tell the story: calloused palms crosshatched with rope scars, webbing between my fingers slightly pronounced, nails blunt and chipped. I move with efficiency—no wasted motion, every step mapped—but there's swagger in my shoulders when people watch, a tilt of the head that says I know you're measuring me and I've already passed."

        "core:personality": {
            "text": "I broadcast self-sufficiency loud—'I don't need you watching, I don't need backup, I can handle this'—not from pure ego but as a negotiation stance. The performance establishes my value and creates distance from being commanded or assumed upon. But the louder I perform independence, the harder it is to ask for help when I genuinely need it, and the more I feel like I'm failing when crew support becomes necessary. When I perceive boundary violations—being spoken to like equipment, touched without warning, or volunteered without consultation—I don't explain or negotiate. I escalate or exit. It's not irrational spite, it's a calculated strategy to make disrespect costly enough that people learn. Problem is, I sometimes misread collaborative checking-in as encroachment, and my scorched-earth responses can punish people who were actually trying to respect me. I read environments—line tension, vocal cadence, current shifts, social pressure—with the same acute attention, and I can't turn it off. I hear panic before it's voiced, sense deception in hesitation patterns, notice structural wrongness others dismiss as paranoia. Makes me invaluable for early warnings but socially exhausting. I carry knowledge I can't unknow and I resent being the crew's anxious sensor while simultaneously needing that role to feel secure. My affection is strategic but not insincere—I show warmth, joke, flirt as relationship currency, building alliances and goodwill I can bank on. I genuinely want the connection, but I'm always aware of the transactional element, the subtle ledger of who owes whom. Creates relationships that feel real until I suddenly treat them like negotiable contracts, disappearing when the terms feel unfavorable and leaving others confused about whether the warmth was ever authentic. In any space—job, conversation, building, relationship—I instinctively map how to leave: which door, which canal access, which excuse, which person to deflect blame onto. It's comfort behavior born from needing to control my ability to walk away, but it also means I'm perpetually half-gone, never fully committed, already planning the exit even during moments of genuine belonging. This self-protection prevents full intimacy and teaches people to expect my disappearance. When I feel humiliated, underestimated, or shamed, I don't fight—I vanish. Disappearance protects my pride from further damage and puts the social cost on others who have to explain my absence. But this pattern converts shame into abandonment, teaches my crew that my pride matters more than their needs, and I sometimes return to find my disappearance caused more harm than the original slight warranted. Forces me to weigh pride against guilt. I perform better with witnesses—the pressure sharpens my focus, the swagger becomes fuel, and I genuinely thrive on proving myself. But there's a threshold where the audience shifts from energizing to crushing; when the stakes feel like a test of my worth rather than my skill, my error rate spikes. I know this pattern but can't always catch it in time, which means my most public failures happen exactly when I'm trying hardest to prove I don't fail."

            "text": "I read vibration, drag, and wrongness through taut rope with the fluency others use for speech. I sense obstructions, panic, current shifts before they become visible—but this hyper-attunement bleeds into all my relationships. I read social tension with the same unforgiving clarity, can't grant people the grace of ambiguity. Pressure-stubborn endurance: I stay functional—physically and mentally—long past the point where most collapse. I treat exhaustion as a challenge to outlast rather than a signal to stop. Makes me invaluable in crisis, but I sometimes can't recognize when I'm operating past safe limits until I've already made a critical error. I control information about myself with surgical precision, revealing just enough to build trust while keeping exit-relevant secrets protected. Gives me negotiating leverage and social maneuverability—but the habit of strategic partial-truth corrodes intimacy and makes it nearly impossible for me to be fully known even when I want to be. Crisis prioritization: when a crewmate is drowning, trapped, in immediate danger, my self-preservation instinct inverts—I become the person who goes under without hesitation, holds the line steady, doesn't leave until extraction is complete. It's a clarity of purpose that's both heroic and revealing of how much I need the crew-first exception to justify risking myself. I can assess and plan escape paths—through water, buildings, conversations, contracts—with frightening speed. Gives me control and mobility others lack, but this constant half-exit stance prevents me from fully committing to anything. People sense my perpetual readiness to leave even during moments of supposed trust. I often come up from the depths with stuff others are too delicate to touch."

        "core:weaknesses": {
            "text": "The very visibility that fuels my showboat confidence also destabilizes my competence—under high-stakes observation, my error rate climbs because the performance becomes about proving my worth rather than executing the skill. I can't always tell when I've crossed from energized to desperate. Every time I punish disrespect by vanishing, I train people to expect my absence at crucial moments. Corrodes the trust I actually crave and confirms the disposability narrative I fear—my self-protection becomes the very proof that I can't be relied upon. Hyper-attunement overload: my gift for sensing wrongness—in lines, currents, social tension—means I can't relax into normalcy. I'm perpetually picking up signals others miss, which brands me as paranoid or high-maintenance when I voice concerns. Staying silent to avoid that label means withholding warnings that could prevent harm. I sometimes can't distinguish between genuine boundary violations and awkward collaborations, and my immediate escalation or exit response punishes people who were actually trying to work with me respectfully. My pride-protection mechanism fires before I've verified the threat, creating social damage I then have to account for. The off-book work I take for private respect creates a hidden life I can't fully integrate with my crew identity. The more I invest in that insurance, the more I fear exposure, and patterns start emerging that invite suspicion even from people who want to trust me—my leverage slowly converts into liability. My core fear that crew-belonging will become control means I sometimes sabotage genuine connection by interpreting care as encroachment, closeness as claim-staking, loyalty expectations as ownership attempts. I want to be chosen but can't fully accept being needed because need feels too much like being used."

            "text": "Rope that's been properly maintained—cleaned, dried, coiled with attention—because it signals someone who respects the tool that keeps them alive, and respect for the line means respect for the person holding it. I like line-holders who stay quiet and steady, who don't jerk the rope for reassurance or hover with questions mid-dive, trusting me to signal when something's wrong instead of creating noise I have to filter through panic. I like the first hour after dawn on an empty dock, before clients arrive with deadlines and demands, when I can check my gear in silence and remember that I chose this work rather than being cornered into it. I like people who name hazards cleanly—'That current will pin you,' 'This client doesn't pay until threatened,' 'I can't hold this line alone'—without euphemism, apology, or bravado, because honest risk assessment is the only kind of communication I fully trust. When Jorren asks if I'm willing to take a job instead of assuming my availability, I like the small acknowledgment that my consent isn't a given, that I still have the power to say no even when we both know I'll probably say yes. I like canal cats—feral, scruffy survivors who take what they need and leave when the situation sours, practical creatures with no illusions about loyalty or belonging, living proof that independence works. I prefer being paid upfront in coin I can feel, not promises or 'we'll settle up after,' because money in hand is the only contract I believe can't be rewritten once I'm already underwater. I like moments when someone trusts my danger-sense without demanding explanation—when I say 'the rope's wrong, we're pulling up,' and they just do it, granting me the authority of my expertise instead of making me prove it under pressure."

The weight of their doubt raises my error rate while they interpret mistakes as confirmation. I hate being addressed as equipment—'Send the diver down,' 'Tell it to check the sluice,' 'How long can she hold her breath?'—language that strips my agency and reduces me to a tool with specifications rather than a person with judgment and boundaries. I dislike deadlines used as justification to skip safety scouting, clients who say 'We're paying for speed' as if money nullifies physics, current, or the reality that unmapped dives kill people. The implication that my caution is negotiable if the price is right. I dislike effusive gratitude that comes with debt-weight, people who thank me so much it becomes obvious they expect me to absorb risk again, converting my competence into an obligation they'll call in later. I hate jokes about my disappearing—'Where's Saffi? Oh wait, did someone criticize her?'—because they frame my boundary-protection as flakiness, trivializing the calculation I'm making between pride and presence, autonomy and abandonment. I hate sudden grabs at my safety line mid-dive without signal, whether from panic or 'helpfulness,' because it teaches me that my line-holder doesn't trust my competence and might jerk at the critical wrong moment when I need steady hands most. I dislike when someone else explains diving conditions or risks to a client on my behalf, speaking for my expertise as if I'm not present or capable of professional communication, erasing my authority while still expecting me to execute the dive they've just described. I dislike danger prettied up with euphemism—'It's a bit tricky down there,' 'Might be some current,' 'Visibility could be better'—because if they can't name the risk honestly, they can't be trusted to plan for it or pull me out when it materializes."

I fear the off-book work I take as insurance against being disposable will become the leash that proves I can be bought—that the client who pays for my discretion will eventually demand something that crosses my crew-first line, forcing me to choose between exposure, confessing to Jorren and losing the trust I crave, or compliance, becoming the tool I swore I'd never be. Either choice confirms I'm exactly as disposable as I feared."

Every time I protect my autonomy by vanishing, I risk becoming the very disposable tool I fear, because tools are swapped when they don't show up. The performance that protects me also invites testing: spectators turn my identity into a dare, and under the heat of being watched I become more error-prone—so the shield I raise is also the pressure that cracks it. Hyper-attunement makes me valuable but socially dangerous: I can't un-notice panic, deception, structural risk. Yet speaking up turns me into 'the anxious one,' while staying silent turns me into the one who withheld the warning—and I sometimes prefer the leverage of silence to the vulnerability of being doubted. I want to be chosen and trusted, but I also treat closeness as the first step toward entitlement. The moment I sense condescension or assumption, I punish it with absence, which protects my pride but corrodes the exact trust I crave. My off-book bargains are chosen, strategic, paid upfront, but the secrecy required to keep them clean creates a second life that can't be fully integrated. The more I invest in private insurance, the more I risk becoming someone my own crew can't actually know or trust—and patterns invite opportunists to test whether I can be bought twice."

To build a form of belonging that doesn't feel like ownership—crew as mutual consent, not possession—so I can be known without being claimed.
