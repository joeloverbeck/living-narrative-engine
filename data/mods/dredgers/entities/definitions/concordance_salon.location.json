            "text": "The room is a small, formal sitting space with muted, low lighting. Three upholstered armchairs in pale beige and gray form a loose arc around a rectangular wooden coffee table. On the table lie several neat stacks of papers, spread in ordered piles, with a metal tray holding a seal or stamp near one corner. The floor is carpeted in a similar neutral tone, and the walls are paneled and painted in a soft, warm shade. To the left, a tall bookcase stands against the wall, filled with uniformly bound volumes. A narrow side table in front of it holds a simple ceramic vase with pale dried flowers. On the far wall a round clock hangs above an empty stretch of paneling. To the right, heavy curtains frame a single tall window; sheer inner curtains diffuse a strip of cool daylight into the room. Beneath the window, a small wooden desk or console table holds a few small framed items and a closed box. Another chair with wooden arms sits nearby, angled slightly toward the center of the room."
