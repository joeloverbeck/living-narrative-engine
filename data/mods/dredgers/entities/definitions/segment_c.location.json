The footpath is more slurry than ground—mud kneaded by boots into a slick paste over uneven stone. The water channel presses close and looks more “alive” in the worst way, with slow folds and lazy eddies that shouldn’t exist without a current. There are more places where you can’t see the bottom—even in the shallows—because the water is opaque and the silt hangs in it like smoke. The sense of being pulled toward it becomes harder to ignore, like the space itself is politely suggesting you step in and stop resisting."
