The ceiling is higher here, but it’s a cluttered height—beams and supports crossing like a rough cage. Chalk marks and measuring strings lace the walls; a few abandoned tools sit where workers dropped them and never came back. The lighting is practical and ugly: lanterns on hooks, soot-stained glass, shadows in every corner. There’s a sharp mix of smells—wet stone, fresh-split timber, and the sour hint of canal rot seeping in from somewhere deeper. You can see where the culvert line was uncovered: a section of old channel wall exposed like bone, with mud and silt packed hard around it."
