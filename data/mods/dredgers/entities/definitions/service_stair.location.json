            "text": "A narrow, staff-only stairwell tucked into the east wing—stone steps worn into a shallow dish from decades of boots and buckets. The walls are close and sweat-cold, plaster over brick with dark timber trim that’s been scuffed by carried crates. A handrail runs along one side, smooth where hands have polished it; on the other, iron hooks hold a few spare lanterns and coil ends of rope that no one remembers claiming. The air changes as you descend: upstairs polish and fabric gives way to damp lime and old stone. Sound carries weirdly—voices above turn into muffled thumps, while anything below echoes up like it’s coming from a deeper throat."
