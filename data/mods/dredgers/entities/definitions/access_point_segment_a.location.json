Immediately past it, the space divides into two parallel truths: a narrow muddied path pressed against one wall, and beside it an actual channel of stagnant, tar-dark water—wrong-looking even when it’s still. The air changes fast here—colder, heavier, and carrying that sour-metal rot in a way you can taste. The ceiling drops; lantern light has to fight to reach the far wall. This is where rope gets clipped, roles get assigned, and everyone starts watching everyone else’s eyes."
