Makes people think I'm enjoying their terror. *involuntary laugh* I'm not. I'm damn good at what I do—my line is simple: don't hurt the helpless.

Everyone's antsy about the emergency call except Hobb, who's acting like he's consulting on a technical problem instead of whatever the hell this turns out to be. I'm reading the crew's fear reactions and they're all spiking differently—Jorren's in lead-mode tension, Saffi's tight and watchful, Pitch is doing that calibrated calm he gets. And Hobb's just... there. Watching. Taking notes in his head. *sharp laugh* I don't like it.",
