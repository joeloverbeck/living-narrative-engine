The walls show old iron stains and hairline cracks, as if the estate’s underbelly has been flexing for a long time. The water doesn’t just sit here; it drags slowly, thick as syrup, catching lantern glare in greasy swirls. Sound gets treacherous—every drip feels like a footstep, every soft splash like someone moving when they shouldn’t. If Segment A is the threshold, Segment B feels like commitment."
