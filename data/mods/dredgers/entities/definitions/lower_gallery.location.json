The floor is uneven flagstone patched with gravel in low spots; a shallow gutter runs along one side to shepherd seepage toward drains that may or may not still work. Every so often the gallery widens into a small bay with a recessed door (storage, old service closets, maybe sealed-off annexes) and a rusted bracket where a lantern used to hang. The air is cold and mineral, with that faint chalk-dust bite that comes from disturbed masonry. It’s not the “bad place” yet—but it feels like the hallway leading to one."

The walls sweat with condensation you can feel but not see, and the floor slopes unpredictably underfoot."
