      "text": "A wide-mouthed scoop with a perforated bowl, designed to lift sludge while letting water drain through. The holes are small enough to catch the muck but large enough to keep the load manageable. The handle curves back toward the wrist, making it easier to work in the cramped angles where buckets can't reach. Years of use have worn the grip smooth and stained the metal with the particular gray-brown of tunnel sediment. When you need to clear around something delicate—or when a shovel would disturb more than it removes—you reach for the dredge scoop and take it one bite at a time."
