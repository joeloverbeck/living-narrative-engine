# Distress Mod

This directory houses the assets for the Distress mod, focused on body language that conveys vulnerability, pleading, or internalized overwhelm. Action, rule, condition, and scope definitions will be added in future iterations following the patterns established by the Affection, Caressing, and Kissing mods.

## Planned Palettes

- **Primary**: Dark Red Alert
- **Secondary**: Obsidian Frost (shared with the distress mod entry in the WCAG palette spec)

The subdirectories mirror the standard mod layout:

- `actions/` – Gesture interaction definitions.
- `conditions/` – Condition builders for triggering distress states.
- `rules/` – Narrative rule handling for distress gestures.
- `scopes/` – Spatial and relational scopes relevant to distressed poses.
