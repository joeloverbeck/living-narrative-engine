      "text": "A charming traditional dirndl in rose-pink, crafted from a blend of crisp linen and soft cotton. The fitted bodice features a low-cut square neckline that displays a generous expanse of decolletage, laced at the front with darker pink ribbon. The full, gathered skirt falls to mid-calf, swaying pleasantly with each step. Delicate floral embroidery adorns the bodice edges in deeper rose and cream threads. This is the dress of Alpine meadows and village festivals—practical yet undeniably feminine."
