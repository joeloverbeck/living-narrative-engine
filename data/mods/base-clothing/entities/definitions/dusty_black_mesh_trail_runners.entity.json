      "text": "Low-cut trail running shoes in dusty black, the mesh uppers permanently stained with the memory of a hundred miles of mountain paths. The aggressive lugged soles still grip well on loose scree, though the tread pattern has smoothed in the high-wear zones. Breathable and quick-drying, they've sacrificed any pretense of water resistance for the ability to shed moisture fast—the kind of footwear that says their owner would rather run through streams than around them."
