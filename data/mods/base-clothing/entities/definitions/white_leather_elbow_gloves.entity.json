      "text": "Opera-length gloves in supple white leather, extending past the elbow in the formal style favored at courtly functions. The leather is fine-grained and immaculately maintained, soft enough to permit delicate manipulation yet formal enough to signal elevated status. Tiny mother-of-pearl buttons secure the inner wrist, allowing the gloves to be donned and removed without struggling. These are gloves for receiving honored guests, signing treaties, or lifting a wine glass at a state banquet—accessories that transform every gesture into a statement of refined grace."
