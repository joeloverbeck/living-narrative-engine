The rich burgundy fabric is accented by a row of tarnished brass buttons down the front, their weathered patina adding character and a sense of lived-in elegance. The structured cut provides a sleek silhouette that works beautifully under jackets or on its own. Perfect for a bard's performance attire, combining sophistication with just a hint of bohemian charm."
