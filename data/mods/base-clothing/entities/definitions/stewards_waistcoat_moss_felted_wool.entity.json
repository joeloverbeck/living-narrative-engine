      "text": "A sleeveless waistcoat of felted wool dyed the dull green of marsh moss. The felting has rendered the fabric dense and water-resistant, ideal for those who work in mist and drizzle. Simple bone buttons secure the front, and small pockets at each hip hold the implements of a working steward—chalk for marking, twine for binding, a stub of pencil for tallying. The garment speaks of modest authority among laborers."
