      "text": "Technical hiking trousers in slate gray, cut from lightweight ripstop nylon that dries in minutes after a river crossing. The fabric has that slight sheen of synthetic performance gear, with articulated knees for scrambling and gusseted cuffs that zip tight against boots or roll up for wading. Multiple pockets with velcro closures, a built-in webbing belt, and mesh-lined vents at the thighs—practical trail clothing for someone who spends more time outdoors than in."
