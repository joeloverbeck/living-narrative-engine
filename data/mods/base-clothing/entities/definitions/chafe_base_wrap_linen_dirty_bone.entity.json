The fabric is thin but sturdy, meant to lie flat against the skin and prevent the heavy oilskin jacket from chafing during long dives. Where the wrap winds across the ribs and shoulders, the weave has gone gray-brown with use, the original color only visible at the edges where it tucks in. A diver's first layer—unseen, unglamorous, essential."
