      "text": "Classic black breeches cut in the traditional style, fitted through the hips and thighs before tapering dramatically at the knee. The snug fit below the knee creates a sleek silhouette that works beautifully with tall boots or wraps. Made from durable cotton twill with a subtle stretch for freedom of movement, these breeches combine period aesthetic with practical comfort. The dark color and clean lines make them a versatile foundation for any performance ensemble."
