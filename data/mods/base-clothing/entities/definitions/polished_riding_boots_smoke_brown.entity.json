      "text": "Classic riding boots in smoke-brown calf leather, polished to a mirror shine that reflects ambient light. The warm brown carries a subtle grayish undertone, lending sophistication without severity. Rising to mid-calf, they provide ankle support and protection while remaining elegant enough for formal indoor wear. The soles are thin leather for quiet movement across polished floors, though a slight heel offers proper stirrup purchase should riding actually be required. These are boots that proclaim their wearer equally at home in saddle or salon."
