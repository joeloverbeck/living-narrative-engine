The knees are double-layered with reinforced panels, already showing the pale scuffing of countless hours spent kneeling on rough surfaces. Patches of mismatched canvas mark where the original fabric gave way, each repair a badge of continued service. Wide through the thigh for ease of climbing and crouching."
