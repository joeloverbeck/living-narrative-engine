    "actor_description": "It hits and my thoughts simply… fail to line up. I can feel the weight of it somewhere behind my ribs, but my mind keeps sliding off the meaning like it can’t get purchase. The world goes a little unreal—sounds distant, edges too sharp—while I keep moving on autopilot. I’m here, I’m looking, but it hasn’t finished becoming true inside me.",
    "description_text": "{actor} goes suddenly still in a strangely intact way—eyes fixed, face drained, as if they’re waiting for the feeling to render. Their movements turn mechanical and delayed, like they’re following instructions rather than inhabiting them.",

Triggers only on a grief spike or sharp valence drop."
