      "text": "Cold, green light washes over a drowned stone shore. Stepped slabs that descend to black water, where slow ripples break the reflection of a starfield twisting in impossible arcs. Cyclopean arches rise from the mist like vertebrae, some intact, some shattered, their curves too perfect and too wrong. Leaning monoliths flank the inlet; small hexagonal insets glow faintly along their faces, pulsing as if listening. The ground is a crust of dark, cracked plates, thin seams leaking a dim emerald luminescence. Far out across the slick flats, fog hides most shapes, but a colossal, tentacled silhouette looms and shifts behind it, more sensed than seen."
