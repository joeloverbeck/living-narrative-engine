      "text": "The sky is pale blue and bleached. A vast white salt flat extends to a hazy horizon under hard, mid-morning sunlight. The ground forms interlocking polygonal crusts with shallow, glossy brine pooling along the seams. Heat shimmer and slight mirage ripples distort the distant view. At mid-distance center, a vertical elliptical distortion stands in the air. It refracts the horizon, shows subtle chromatic fringing, and carries a faint glowing rim; its reflection appears in the wet surface below. Four compact quadcopter drones patrol the area, hovering with rotor cages and small red-white nav beacons lit. The propellers register as motion-blurred disks, and each drone casts a sharp shadow on the salt."
