            "text": "Elena Amezua. That's what's on the contract badge. Page 1, subsection A, with the little holographic seal that's supposed to prevent forgery. Len is what I let people I trust call me. If you've earned it. You haven't. I'm 37—old enough to have had a previous career and watched someone delete the emails that would've proven I was right. Young enough that part of me, the part I can't quite kill off no matter how much evidence I show it, still thinks I can start over. Broad shoulders. Work-built, not gym-built. I don't look \"tactical.\" I look like someone who's carried 40-kilo drums of solvent and welded exhaust grates in a refinery at 3 a.m. when the night shift supervisor called in drunk. My posture's compressed because my back hurts all the time—L4-L5 disc compression, documented but not covered because it's \"pre-existing.\" Face is wind-burned. Permanent squint from too many sun-blasted shifts. Got a healed split on my lip that never quite smoothed out. My jaw's tight because I grind my teeth. The dentist said I'd need a mouth guard. The dentist costs money. Knuckles are slightly swollen from years of impact trauma. Not fight scars—accumulated microfractures from wrenching frozen valves and hammering seized equipment. There's a permanent divot in my left shoulder where a falling wrench caught me and the company doctor said the bone chips were \"cosmetic,\" meaning not their problem. I have the posture of someone bracing for the next thing to fall—weight forward, never fully relaxed, like I'm perpetually about to catch something or run. Used to work industrial safety before a containment event destroyed my career and reputation. Now I'm a private contractor on a remote assignment, watching a phenomenon I'm not supposed to talk about—NDA on page 8, subsections 3.2 through 3.9—sending most of my pay to family, operating under contractual restrictions that leave me with almost no autonomy. Never planned to be here. But money and lack of options have a way of making choices for you."

            "text": "I'm calm, but not 'zen calm.' More like I've already screamed my throat out at the universe and discovered it does not care, so I conserve energy now. I'm methodical. Every 30 minutes I walk the same perimeter arc, even though the auto-drones technically do it. I don't trust automation because I've seen inspection drones file 'green' on cracked welds. Officially, my personal record-keeping is a violation of data security protocol. Unofficially, it's my insurance. If—when—something happens and corporate 'can't reconstruct telemetry,' I can. I don't small-talk much, which Crace interprets as 'cold.' It's not that. It's if I start talking about real things, I'll start caring about him, and I can't afford to care about people who walk into industrial fans for a paycheck. I track favors, slights, and debts with ledger-book precision. Someone covers my shift, I remember and repay it exactly. Someone takes credit for my work, I'll engineer a situation six months later where they fail publicly. It's not strategy—it's the moral physics of someone who needs the universe to balance because if effort doesn't correlate to outcome, nothing means anything. I don't just imagine worst-case scenarios—I script them, complete with procedural responses and contingency documentation. It looks like paranoia but it's actually a coping mechanism from past trauma: if I can predict and plan the disaster, maybe this time I'll be believed. The tragedy is that my scripts never account for the actual shape of chaos when it arrives. I'm not closed off—I'm a one-way valve. I'll absorb everyone else's complaints, fears, and logistical problems without reciprocating vulnerability. I become the repository for other people's shit while revealing nothing, which makes me indispensable and totally isolated. People think they know me because I listen. They have no idea I've disappeared behind the listening."

I taught myself contract law basics through free online resources after my career imploded, not to become a lawyer but to understand exactly how I'd been fucked and develop literacy in the language of my own exploitation."

When I'm too tired to care anymore I interpret the numbness as wisdom or professional detachment rather than recognizing I'm dissociating. Even when I know speaking up is futile or dangerous, I have to log it, report it, document my objection, which creates paper trails that make me a liability. I read all authority through the lens of my previous betrayal—cannot differentiate between incompetent leadership and malicious leadership, treat every supervisor as potentially the person who will delete my emails when bodies drop. My industrial-disaster framework makes me blind to threats that don't follow institutional-failure patterns—I'm looking for budget cuts and deferred maintenance, not ontological breakdowns, so the anomaly's actual behavior keeps surprising me."

I hate people who treat corporate employment as identity—coworkers who say 'we' when referring to the company, who wear branded merch off-shift, who've internalized the org chart as a family tree. I can't stand verbal agreements or promises without paper trails—if it's not documented it didn't happen, and people who operate on handshakes are either naive or setting me up. Team-building exercises or forced socialization—the humiliation of pretending that trust-falls and icebreakers can substitute for job security and fair wages."

I fear that I resent Leire not just for the financial dependency but for surviving—for being the sister who got to stay fragile, who gets to be cared for, whose needs are legible and sympathetic, while I had to become the hard one, the capable one, the one who doesn't get to break, and that resentment means I'm the kind of person who begrudges someone their autoimmune disease."

My compulsive record-keeping has metastasized from professional discipline into magical thinking—I know my logs are unread, my reports filed into void, yet I continue with religious fervor because stopping would mean admitting that my entire value system—documentation equals accountability equals mattering—was always a fairy tale I told myself to survive being disposable. Finding evidence that the rift is corporate malfeasance would validate my entire worldview and restore my sense of competence, but it would also mean I'm once again the person who sees the tank thinning, who knows the disaster is preventable, who has the receipts—and I've already lived through what happens to that person, so part of me needs the anomaly to remain inexplicable so I have an excuse not to fight."

I'm trying to architect a system so methodical and irrefutable that reality itself cannot be gaslit—to create documentation so perfect that erasure becomes impossible, not to expose the corporation but to prove to myself that objective truth can still exist in a world that demonstrated it doesn't. I'm working to achieve such complete professional detachment that I can witness catastrophe—human, cosmic, bureaucratic—with the affectless calm of reading instrument panels, because if I can reduce the rift to data and the dying to 'incidents' I won't have to feel complicit in my own immobilization. I want to be given explicit, unambiguous orders when the crisis comes—not because I've been conditioned to obey but because being told what to do means someone else absorbs the moral and financial liability for the outcome, and I've discovered that surrendering agency is the only form of safety left to someone the system has marked as perpetually at-fault."

If I uncover proof that this catastrophe was preventable and documented and ignored, do I have any obligation to do anything with that knowledge, or have I earned the right to stay silent and collect my paycheck while the world ends on schedule? Has the behavioral remediation clause genuinely damaged my capacity for autonomous moral action, or have I seized on it as permission to indulge the exhausted fantasy of letting the world burn while I watch from behind the liability waiver?"

Because they need a narrative where the ex-military guy goes rogue and I'm just collateral, actually.",
