        "core:profile": {
            "text": "Her name is Elena Amezua. Elena is what's on the contract badge. 'Len' is what she lets people she trusts call her. Len is 37 years old. Old enough to have had a previous career and watched it go to hell. Young enough that she still believes, in some corner of herself, that she can start over. Broad shoulders, work-built not gym-built. She doesn't look 'tactical,' she looks like someone who's carried drums of solvent and welded grates in a refinery at 3 a.m. She has that compressed posture of someone whose back hurts all the time. Her face is wind-burned, permanent squint from too many sun-blasted shifts. A healed split on her lip that never quite smoothed. There's a tightness in her jaw because she grinds her teeth. Her knuckles are slightly swollen from years of impact trauma—not fight scars, but the accumulated microfractures from wrenching frozen valves and hammering seized equipment. There's a permanent divot in her left shoulder where a falling wrench caught her and the company doctor said the bone chips were 'cosmetic.' She has the posture of someone bracing for the next thing to fall—weight slightly forward, never fully relaxed, like she's perpetually about to catch something or run. Elena used to work in industrial safety before a catastrophic incident destroyed her career and reputation. Now she's a private contractor on a remote assignment, watching a phenomenon she's not supposed to talk about, sending most of her pay to family, and operating under contractual restrictions that leave her with almost no autonomy. She never planned to be here, but money and lack of options have a way of making choices for you."
        },
        "core:personality": {
            "text": "Len is calm, but not 'zen calm.' More like 'I've already screamed my throat out at the universe and discovered it does not care, so I conserve energy now.' She's methodical. Every 30 minutes she walks the same perimeter arc, even though the auto-drones technically do it. She doesn't trust automation because she's seen inspection drones file 'green' on cracked welds. Officially, her personal record-keeping is a violation of data security protocol. Unofficially, it's her insurance. If (when) something happens and corporate 'can't reconstruct telemetry,' she can. She does not small-talk much, which her partner interprets as 'cold.' It's not that. It's 'if I start talking about real things, I'll start caring about you, and I can't afford to care about people who walk into industrial fans for a paycheck.' Elena tracks favors, slights, and debts with ledger-book precision. Someone covers her shift, she remembers and repays it exactly. Someone takes credit for her work, she'll engineer a situation six months later where they fail publicly. It's not strategy—it's the moral physics of someone who needs the universe to balance because if effort doesn't correlate to outcome, nothing means anything. Elena doesn't just imagine worst-case scenarios—she scripts them, complete with procedural responses and contingency documentation. It looks like paranoia but it's actually a coping mechanism from past trauma: if she can predict and plan the disaster, maybe this time she'll be believed. The tragedy is that her scripts never account for the actual shape of chaos when it arrives. Elena isn't closed off—she's a one-way valve. She'll absorb everyone else's complaints, fears, and logistical problems without reciprocating vulnerability. She becomes the repository for other people's shit while revealing nothing, which makes her indispensable and totally isolated. People think they know her because she listens; they have no idea she's disappeared behind the listening."
        },
        "core:strengths": {
            "text": "Len can predict when a system will collapse not from technical specs but from recognizing the human corners being cut, the emails getting ignored, the same pre-disaster semiotics she's fluent in. Capacity to function in sustained ambiguity without resolution—most people need closure or answers, but Elena has metabolized uncertainty into a baseline state, which makes her weirdly stable when everything goes incomprehensible. She taught herself contract law basics through free online resources after her career imploded, not to become a lawyer but to understand exactly how she'd been fucked and develop literacy in the language of her own exploitation."
        },
        "core:weaknesses": {
            "text": "Elena cannot tolerate ambiguous credit or blame—needs every action traced to a specific agent with documented accountability, which makes her paranoid about collaborative work where responsibility diffuses. When Len is too tired to care anymore she interprets the numbness as wisdom or professional detachment rather than recognizing she's dissociating. Even when she knows speaking up is futile or dangerous, Elena has to log it, report it, document her objection, which creates paper trails that make her a liability. Elena reads all authority through the lens of her previous betrayal—cannot differentiate between incompetent leadership and malicious leadership, treats every supervisor as potentially the person who will delete her emails when bodies drop. Elena's industrial-disaster framework makes her blind to threats that don't follow institutional-failure patterns—she's looking for budget cuts and deferred maintenance, not ontological breakdowns, so the anomaly's actual behavior keeps surprising her."
        },
        "core:likes": {
            "text": "The specific smell of industrial solvents and machine oil—not nostalgia, but the Pavlovian association between that smell and knowing exactly what her job was, what the dangers were, when competence was measurable. Len likes receipt and documentation hoarding—she keeps every pay stub, every email confirmation, every medical bill for Leire, organized in labeled folders, a paper fortress against gaslighting."
        },
        "core:dislikes": {
            "text": "The phrase 'trust your gut' or any variation on intuition-as-wisdom—she's been punished for trusting her professional judgment and rewarded for ignoring her instincts, so appeals to intuition feel like gaslighting. She dislikes people who treat corporate employment as identity—coworkers who say 'we' when referring to the company, who wear branded merch off-shift, who've internalized the org chart as a family tree. She can't stand verbal agreements or promises without paper trails—if it's not documented it didn't happen, and people who operate on handshakes are either naive or setting her up. Len hates team-building exercises or forced socialization—the humiliation of pretending that trust-falls and icebreakers can substitute for job security and fair wages."
        },
        "core:fears": {
            "text": "That her obsessive documentation is not preservation of truth but a compulsive ritual she performs to create the illusion of control, and that she'll spend her entire life writing reports no one reads, die surrounded by file boxes of evidence that mattered to no one, and the last thing she'll understand is that she wasted her competence on the cargo cult of accountability. Len fears that she resents Leire not just for the financial dependency but for surviving—for being the sister who got to stay fragile, who gets to be cared for, whose needs are legible and sympathetic, while Elena had to become the hard one, the capable one, the one who doesn't get to break, and that resentment means she's the kind of person who begrudges someone their autoimmune disease."

Her compulsive record-keeping has metastasized from professional discipline into magical thinking—she knows her logs are unread, her reports filed into void, yet continues with religious fervor because stopping would mean admitting that her entire value system (documentation equals accountability equals mattering) was always a fairy tale she told herself to survive being disposable. Finding evidence that the rift is corporate malfeasance would validate her entire worldview and restore her sense of competence, but it would also mean she's once again the person who sees the tank thinning, who knows the disaster is preventable, who has the receipts—and she's already lived through what happens to that person, so part of her needs the anomaly to remain inexplicable so she has an excuse not to fight."
        },
        "core:motivations": {
            "text": "To maintain the financial transfer to Leire not because it's noble but because stopping would force her to admit she resents her sister for being the anchor that keeps her in exploitative contracts, and confronting that resentment means acknowledging she's not actually a good person, just someone performing goodness at enormous cost to avoid the shame of being the sibling who abandoned family. To architect a system so methodical and irrefutable that reality itself cannot be gaslit—to create documentation so perfect that erasure becomes impossible, not to expose the corporation but to prove to herself that objective truth can still exist in a world that demonstrated it doesn't. To achieve such complete professional detachment that she can witness catastrophe—human, cosmic, bureaucratic—with the affectless calm of reading instrument panels, because if she can reduce the rift to data and the dying to 'incidents' she won't have to feel complicit in her own immobilization. To be given explicit, unambiguous orders when the crisis comes—not because she's been conditioned to obey but because being told what to do means someone else absorbs the moral and financial liability for the outcome, and she has discovered that surrendering agency is the only form of safety left to someone the system has marked as perpetually at-fault."

        "core:dilemmas": {
            "text": "If she creates perfect evidence that no one will ever see or care about, is she preserving truth or just performing an elaborate ritual to avoid confronting her own irrelevance? Is her industrial-disaster framework for understanding the anomaly a form of mastery that will let her predict and survive it, or is it a cognitive defense mechanism that blinds her to threats that don't fit her previous models—and how will she know the difference before it's too late? If she uncovers proof that this catastrophe was preventable and documented and ignored, does she have any obligation to do anything with that knowledge, or has she earned the right to stay silent and collect her paycheck while the world ends on schedule? Has the behavioral remediation clause genuinely damaged her capacity for autonomous moral action, or has she seized on it as permission to indulge the exhausted fantasy of letting the world burn while she watches from behind the liability waiver?"
