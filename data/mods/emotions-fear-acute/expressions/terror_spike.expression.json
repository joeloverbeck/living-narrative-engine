My chest tightens, my breath goes thin, and my thoughts collapse into one blunt question: how do I survive the next few seconds? The room feels sharper and closer, like there's not enough space to move without consequences. I can still act, but it's action through a tunnel-fast, clumsy, and ruled by urgency.",
