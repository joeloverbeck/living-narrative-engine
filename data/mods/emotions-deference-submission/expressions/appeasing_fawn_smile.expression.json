Grounds in elevated threat, low agency, and a deliberate affiliation signal (placation) under a strong regulation clamp (inhibitory_control + baseline self_control). Blocks genuine bonding (trust/affection/attachment) and blocks fight/defiance (protest_anger/rage) and bold approach (courage). Fires only on threat/submission/apprehension spikes or an affiliation jump/crossing so it reads as a reflex safety move, not a trait."
