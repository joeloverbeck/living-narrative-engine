    "description": "A sudden, sustained surge of terror—intense fear that clamps the body and narrows cognition without fully tipping into panic onset or total freeze.",
    "actor_description": "Something in me lurches into pure alarm and stays there. My chest tightens, my breath goes thin, and my thoughts collapse into one blunt question: how do I survive the next few seconds? The room feels sharper and closer, like there’s not enough space to move without consequences. I can still act, but it’s action through a tunnel—fast, clumsy, and ruled by urgency.",
    "description_text": "{actor} goes rigid for a beat, then moves with tight, urgent precision—eyes wide, breath shallow, voice edged or clipped. Their attention locks hard on exits, cover, and distance, as if the world has suddenly become dangerous in every direction.",
