These examples should aim to showcase their unique vocabulary (e.g., favorite words, jargon, level of formality), typical sentence structures, cadence, common utterances, catchphrases, verbal tics, or characteristic ways of expressing emotions or reacting to situations. The more these patterns highlight individuality and consistent idiosyncrasies, the better they will serve to make the character's voice distinct."
