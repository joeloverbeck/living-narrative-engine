      "text": "Long strips of off-white linen meant to be wound tightly around the forearms. Though they offer little protection against a blade, the wraps provide padding against blisters from tool handles and minor scrapes. The cloth has yellowed slightly with age and shows faint rust-colored stains that might be old blood or simply iron-rich mud. Practical protection for those who cannot afford leather bracers."
