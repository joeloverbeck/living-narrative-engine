Multiple D-rings provide attachment points for winch lines, tool clips, and emergency rescue cables. The shoulder straps are padded where they cross the chest, and quick-release buckles allow rapid escape if a load goes wrong. Every extraction worker knows this harness is the difference between being pulled to safety and being dragged into the depths."
