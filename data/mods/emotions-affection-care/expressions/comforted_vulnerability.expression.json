    "actor_description": "I don't have to hold myself up for a second. The tightness behind my ribs unwinds, and I let the weight settle into someone else's steadiness. My breath comes deeper like it's been waiting for permission, and the urge to perform fades into a quiet, grateful softness. I'm still here—just finally safe enough to stop bracing.",
    "description_text": "{actor} visibly eases into closeness—shoulders lowering, breath deepening, posture softening as if they're letting themselves be held. Their expression turns open and tender, a guarded edge giving way to quiet relief.",
