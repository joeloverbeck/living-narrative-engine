    "description": "Heartbreak crash: attachment stays alive even as loss hits—love still pulling forward while grief and loneliness slam in at once. Attention narrows around the missing bond, hope sours, and the body feels too awake to hide from it. Style note: consider adding category 'heartbreak' for blended attachment+loss beats that aren’t cleanly grief-only or shame-only.",

    "actor_description": "Love is still there—bright and stubborn—and that’s what makes it hurt so cleanly. My chest tightens like I’m bracing for impact, and my thoughts keep snapping back to the same person, the same shape of them, like a tongue worrying a sore spot. I feel small and exposed, like I’m failing at being okay, and the future suddenly tastes flat and doubtful. I can’t numb it out; it’s raw, loud, and close.",
    "description_text": "{actor} goes hollow-eyed and tight-chested all at once, as if something inside them dropped hard. Their focus keeps drifting back to one point, jaw clenched, breath uneven—present, but caught on someone they can’t quite let go of.",
