  "actor_description": "The tears don’t ask permission. My throat tightens and suddenly my eyes are hot—like my body found the truth before I did. I try to swallow it down, to keep my face steady, and that only makes it worse. Breath catches. Chest aches. The smallest thought—one image, one sentence—tips me over the edge again. I’m not performing it. I’m not choosing it. It’s just grief leaking out through the only place it can fit, and I can feel myself folding inward around whatever hurts.",
  "description_text": "{actor} blinks hard, but their eyes glass over anyway. Their mouth tightens, chin trembling as they fight for control—and then the fight loses. A quiet hitching breath, shoulders drawing in, and tears gather and spill with the kind of inevitability that makes onlookers instinctively soften.",
