Their face flashes hot red or bleaches pale in seconds. Their eyes snap away from all contact, sometimes squeezing shut, the aversion nearly violent in its speed. Their whole frame collapses inward: shoulders hunched to the ears, arms wrapped tight across the torso, head ducking as if to make themselves smaller, less visible. Every muscle says escape—but they're locked in place, trapped in the attention they're desperately trying to shed.",

Their skin might feel clammy, furnace-hot, or cold. The desperate tension radiates through their frame: they want to vanish, but their body won't cooperate, caught between fleeing and shutting down."
