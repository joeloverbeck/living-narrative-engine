    "actor_description": "My attention won't settle—it keeps snagging on everything, pulling tight. Every sound sharpens into a question mark: footsteps, doors, voices dropping. My eyes track movement before I decide to look, scanning doorways, hands, exits in loops I can't stop running. My chest stays tight, breath never quite deep enough, muscles coiled like I'm about to need them. It's exhausting, but the exhaustion doesn't matter—stopping feels like lowering my guard right before the hit comes. If I just scan one more time, maybe I'll catch it. Maybe I'll be ready.",
    "description_text": "{actor}'s attention never settles. Their head turns at small sounds—a door, a footstep, fabric shifting—eyes snapping to track movement before returning to scan doorways, corners, faces nearby. Their gaze doesn't flow; it jumps, resets, loops back through the same circuit: exits, hands, shadows, entries. Their body stays coiled, weight forward on their feet, shoulders tight, as if they're perpetually about to dodge or brace. Even when nothing happens, they don't relax—they just reset the scan and start again.",

        "tactile": "Even without looking, I can feel the surveillance radiating off someone—the way they hold space like they're tracking everything at once. Their presence feels wound-up, tightly gathered, like standing near a spring that's been compressed and won't release."
