    "description": "Mid-tone threat awareness: controlled unease with deliberate self-restraint-careful, quiet, not yet panic or scanning frenzy.",
    "actor_description": "Something's wrong, and my body knows it before I can name it. I pull everything inward—breath shallow and held high in my chest, movements whittled down to only what's necessary. My muscles stay ready but leashed, like a fist that won't quite close. I watch without seeming to watch, listen without turning my head. Each impulse gets caught and weighed before I let it reach my hands or face. The stillness isn't calm—it's effort, tension wrapped tight and hidden behind neutral silence. I ration everything: words, glances, reactions. Keep the surface smooth while underneath I'm tracking, calculating, deciding what not to do.",
    "description_text": "{actor} shifts into a careful economy of movement—pauses stretch longer, gestures become smaller and more deliberate, face held neutral even when circumstances might  warrant reaction. They seem to be running everything through an internal filter  before responding: a beat too long before answering, eyes that track but don't obviously scan, controlled stillness that reads as intentional rather than frozen.",

The air around them feels compressed, their presence somehow smaller, pulled inward.
