// Scope for actors in closeness where:
// - Actors are facing each other OR actor is behind target
// - Actor is NOT kneeling before entity (can't reach up from kneeling)
// - Entity CAN be kneeling before actor (head/shoulders are reachable)
// Used by actions targeting head/shoulders that work when target kneels before actor
