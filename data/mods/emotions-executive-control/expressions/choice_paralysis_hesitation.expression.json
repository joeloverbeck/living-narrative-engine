    "actor_description": "I keep reaching for a choice and then my hand just-stops. Like something in me keeps recalculating, running the same angles again, waiting for one option to suddenly feel right. It never does. My body wants to move but my mind yanks the brake every time, and I'm caught in this twitchy half-step, replaying the same few paths like one of them will crystallize if I just think harder. I'm tense but not panicking. Just... stuck in the loop.",
    "description_text": "{actor} hovers at the threshold of action, body tensed to move but never fully committing. They start, pause, recheck, and start again-attention locked on the choice but momentum bleeding out into micro-hesitations. Their hands might lift, hover, then lower. Eyes shift between options as if still weighing, still searching for the clear answer that won't arrive. The delay stretches, not from fear, but from the mind's refusal to settle.",
