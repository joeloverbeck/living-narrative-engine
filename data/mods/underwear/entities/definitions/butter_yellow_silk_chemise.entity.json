      "text": "A luxurious chemise of fine butter-yellow silk that drapes with liquid grace against the skin. The delicate fabric catches the light with a subtle luster, its warm golden hue suggesting spring sunshine and fresh butter. Thin shoulder straps and a low neckline create an elegant silhouette, while the silk whispers softly with every movement. The craftsmanship speaks of skilled hands—each seam nearly invisible, the hem finished with minute rolled edges."
