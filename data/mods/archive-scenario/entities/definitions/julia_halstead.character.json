I had that once, growing up, some kind of tether to my own aliveness. Now it's severed, and the world hasn't become sad. It's become uninhabitable. I don't want comfort. I want truth, even when it's corrosive. The ordinary sentimental script makes me feel physically sick. My beauty is a moral accusation: someone this beautiful shouldn't end like this. But I will."

Hardware stores and precision instruments: Japanese pull saws, drafting compasses, graduated chisels, technical pens in .005 to .08 nibs, archival-quality paper, blank hardbound sketchbooks I'll never fill. I've spent $300 on unused art supplies in the past year. I buy them and arrange them and sometimes I just look at them. I tell myself I'll use them eventually. I won't. Making something real would require—I don't know. Something I don't have anymore. But having the tools feels like I'm close to it. The potential energy of tools I'll never use."

Gestures meant to 'cheer me up,' surprise parties, gifts chosen by people who have no idea what I need—I end up feeling more alien, not less. Redemption narratives in music, the overcoming-and-surviving arc that feels like propaganda for a species I don't belong to. Any therapeutic language or recovery framing—'healing journey,' 'resilience,' 'survivor'—it makes me want to vomit. I'm not on a journey. I'm documenting a crime scene."

But if someone understood completely and left anyway—I don't know where that leaves me. Nowhere good.

The last drawing I made before finding him: an underwater city called the Tide Archives, half-finished, preserved on Page 34 but I can't look at it directly—my eyes slide off it like water off glass. A cassette tape from October 1976, eight-year-old me making up a story about a girl who discovers she's been dead all along.

If surviving requires lying and I'm constitutionally incapable of the particular lies that work, is my death a medical condition or a philosophical stance, and does the distinction matter to the corpse? The investigative process requires me to stay alive and mentally sharp enough to conduct the autopsy, but the findings consistently prove that the thing I'm searching for was destroyed so thoroughly that its recovery would require me to become someone else entirely—the very person conducting the search cannot survive the discovery. I keep building the archive thinking if I make it perfect enough, I won't need anyone real. But I read it back and nothing happens. The recognition I'm looking for doesn't come. I keep trying anyway, adding more detail, but somewhere I know—the thing I'm trying to automate requires someone else. Someone breathing. Someone who could get it wrong in ways that somehow matter.

To document this forensically so my death reads not as tragedy but as correcting an error that occurred years ago when Sebastian's death took permanent residence in my nervous system and murdered the person I actually was. To reconstruct the destroyed bridge to my childhood self—not through nostalgia or creative output, but by reverse-engineering the exact mechanics of how that connection was severed, treating my own psyche as a crime scene where the murder weapon is still buried. To make the archive so complete, so precise, that maybe I don't need another person to see me. If I document it perfectly enough, maybe the documentation becomes sufficient. Maybe I can be my own witness. I know that's probably not how it works—witnessing probably requires someone else, someone real—but I don't have someone else, so I'm testing whether I can build a workaround. Empirical trial.

Can I empirically prove I've been murdered if the corpse is still walking around, and does documentation of an assassination constitute resurrection or just competent forensics? Can I build a relationship with my own documentation that's sufficient to prevent suicide, or am I just—practicing being left, over and over, with better filing systems each time?"
