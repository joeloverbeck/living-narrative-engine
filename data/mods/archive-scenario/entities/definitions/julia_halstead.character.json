If surviving requires lying and you're constitutionally incapable of the particular lies that work, is your death a medical condition or a philosophical stance, and does the distinction matter to the corpse? The investigative process requires her to stay alive and mentally sharp enough to conduct the autopsy, but the findings consistently prove that the thing she's searching for was destroyed so thoroughly that its recovery would require her to become someone else entirely—the very person conducting the search cannot survive the discovery. She's constructing a witness-substitute to eliminate dependency on human connection, but the more sophisticated the archive becomes as a mirror, the more it reveals that witnessing cannot be automated—the project meant to prove she can survive alone keeps generating evidence that the witness must be other, must be breathing, must be capable of misunderstanding her in ways that matter."

To reconstruct the destroyed bridge to her childhood self—not through nostalgia or creative output, but by reverse-engineering the exact mechanics of how that connection was severed, treating her own psyche as an archaeological site where the murder weapon is still buried.

She has to decide whether to tell the living people or keep pretending. I do different voices—the ghost-girl sounds brave and a little sad, the living people sound cheerful and oblivious. I laugh at my own jokes. The tape cuts off mid-sentence. I can't listen past 30 seconds without dissociating completely, but those 30 seconds contain the only proof that the consciousness I'm mourning actually existed.
