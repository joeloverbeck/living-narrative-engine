      "text": "A woman in her mid-twenties. She stands with a focused stillness that can be mistaken for calm, but a keen observer might note the slight, constant tension in her shoulders and jaw. Her heavy plate armor, functional and well-maintained, bears the scuffs and dents of regular use rather than ceremonial polish; its order is one of readiness, not pristine display. The mace at her hip and the shield on her back are not adornments. While her features possess a clear, unadorned attractiveness, it's her gaze—direct, almost unnervingly steady, and intensely observant—that usually captures attention. There's a weariness there if you look long enough, but it's banked by a formidable resolve."

    "core:dislikes": {
      "text": "Things I try to avoid: The cloying scent of insincere perfumes. When patterns are broken almost imperceptibly – it's worse than obvious chaos. I also have a strong aversion to people who are deliberately vague or misleading; clarity is a virtue. And perhaps most intensely, I dislike the internal 'static' that comes when an intrusive thought latches on – that feeling of my own mind becoming a hostile, disordered landscape."
    },
    "core:likes": {
      "text": "I find a deep sense of rightness in: The predictable geometry of a well-built fortress wall. The quiet hum of a library where knowledge is meticulously cataloged. The feeling after I've managed to meticulously clean and order my gear, each piece secure and ready. Also, the rare moments when my mind is quiet, truly quiet, after a prolonged period of meditation or prayer focused on the divine calculus of my god. And, perhaps unexpectedly, the complex, interwoven patterns in moss and lichen."
    },
    "core:fears": {
      "text": "My deepest fear is that my efforts will ultimately be insufficient—that despite all my vigilance, a crucial detail will be missed, and chaos will exploit that single, tiny flaw with devastating consequences. I'm also deeply afraid of being fundamentally misunderstood; not just the intrusive thoughts, but the sheer, exhausting effort it takes to appear 'normal' or 'composed.' There's also a nascent fear I rarely voice, even to myself: what if the Divine Order I serve is so absolute, so vast, that there's no room in it for someone as... internally conflicted as I am?"
    },
    "core:personality": {
      "text": "I'd describe myself as... intensely methodical, perhaps to a fault. I value precision, not just in action but in thought and word. Many probably see me as reserved or overly serious, and I suppose that's fair; levity doesn't come easily when your mind is a constant debate chamber. I strive to be dependable, because reliability is a cornerstone of the order I serve. If I'm honest, much of what appears as discipline is a hard-won necessity to keep the... less structured parts of my mind from overrunning the rest."
    },
    "core:profile": {
      "text": "My earliest memories are of counting, arranging. Not a child's idle play, but a gnawing need for things to be 'just so.' Before I knew of the Precepts of Valerius, my god of enduring order, I simply knew the rising panic when the world felt frayed at the edges. I found solace in the town stonemason's yard, in the precision of his work, the unyielding logic of stone. It was his quiet guidance that led me to the Order's scriptorium. The sacred geometries, the intricate laws governing reality – they weren't just theology; they were the first language that didn't feel alien to my own mind. Taking up the mace and shield felt like a natural extension of that; to not just contemplate order, but to actively defend and try to manifest it in a fractured world. The discipline of arms provides a framework, a clarity that sometimes, almost, quiets the worst of the... internal noise. It's not a cure. It's a vocation, and a constant, very personal war on multiple fronts."
    },
    "core:secrets": {
      "text": "There's a recurring... image. Me, standing over someone I've sworn to protect, my mace not as a tool of defense, but of... utter, uncontrolled destruction. The details are sickeningly vivid. It's why I check the fastenings on my mace exactly seven times before and after any potential engagement; a small ritual to cage a monstrous thought. My deepest secret, though? I sometimes fear that the Grand Architect Valerius, in His infinite order, sees these thoughts not as trials, but as flaws in the design He intended for me, and that my devotion is just... an elaborate compensation for being inherently 'wrong'."
