    "actor_description": "It hits all at once—the snap, the flood. My chest breaks wide open, ribs spreading like I've been breathing shallow for hours and just now remembered how. Heat rushes up through my throat; my shoulders slam down and I feel vertebrae I forgot I had. Laughter punches out before I can shape it—raw, untidy, half-shout. The weight I was carrying dissolves so fast I almost stumble forward into the space it left. Salt on my lips, blood hammering bright in my skull, and underneath everything: the clean, simple fact that we fucking did it. My hands are shaking but not from fear this time. From the afterburn of getting there.",
    "description_text": "{actor}'s body unlocks in a visible rush—the snap of held breath finally released. Their chest lifts and opens, shoulders dropping several inches as tension drains visibly downward. A sound breaks free: sharp, uncontrolled, half-laugh and half-shout, the kind that comes when pressure finds an exit. Their movements suddenly expand, taking up space they'd been ceding, hands spreading wide or punching air. The grin isn't chosen—it splits their face like the only possible response to the weight coming off.",
    "alternate_descriptions": {
        "auditory": "A sharp burst cuts through—laughter that's too loud, too sudden, or a single triumphant shout—then the unmistakable sound of held breath releasing: long, shuddering, like a valve finally opened.",
        "tactile": "Someone's energy floods outward suddenly—movements getting bigger, looser, like they've stopped bracing against something. The air between us shifts as they expand into space they'd been holding back from.",
        "olfactory": "The sharp, metallic edge in the air softens—still the salt of exertion, still warm breath, but the tight, sour note of stress-sweat is fading. What's left smells more like effort that paid off than fear that didn't."
