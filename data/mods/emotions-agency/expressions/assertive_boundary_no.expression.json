    "actor_description": "No. The word lands clean inside me—no surge, no shake, just a straight line. My posture firms and my attention narrows to what I will and won’t allow, like a door clicking shut. I don’t need to explain or fight; I just hold the boundary and let the silence do the work.",
    "description_text": "{actor} sets a firm boundary without raising the temperature—voice steady, posture squared, gaze direct. There’s no flare of aggression, just a clear refusal and the sense that the decision is already made.",
