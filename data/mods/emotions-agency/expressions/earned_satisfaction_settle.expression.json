    "description": "Completion satisfaction—the quiet, earned “done” that settles in after effort. It’s competence with a downshift: the body unclenches, attention unhooks, and a small steadiness takes the place of drive. Style note: consider adding category 'completion' for competence-based closure (distinct from calm/relief/triumph).",

    "actor_description": "It lands softly: done. The push in my chest eases and my focus stops gripping so hard, like I can finally put the weight down. I feel a small, private solidness—nothing flashy, just the sense that I handled it. The energy drains out in a good way, leaving me steadier than before.",
