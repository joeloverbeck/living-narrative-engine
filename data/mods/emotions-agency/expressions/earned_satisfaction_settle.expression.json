    "description": "Completion satisfaction—the quiet, earned “done” that settles in after effort. It’s competence with a downshift: the body unclenches, attention unhooks, and a small steadiness takes the place of drive. Style note: consider adding category 'completion' for competence-based closure (distinct from calm/relief/triumph).",
