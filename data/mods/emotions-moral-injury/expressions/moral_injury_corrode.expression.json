    "actor_description": "It feels like something inside me has curdled. The guilt isn’t just heavy—it’s contaminating, like I can’t touch my own thoughts without getting dirty. I keep replaying it until the edges go raw, and the worst part is the certainty: I can’t undo it. The future doesn’t look scary; it looks sealed shut.",

Their face tightens with a faint, self-recoiling revulsion, and their breathing turns shallow, controlled, as if holding themselves together takes all their attention.",
