  "actor_description": "It comes on as warmth before it becomes thought—an easing under my ribs, like my body recognizes them as safe and important. My breathing slows without permission. My shoulders loosen. I feel pulled toward them in a simple, steady way. Not hunger. Not panic. Just this quiet certainty: you matter to me. I want to keep them close enough to protect, close enough to be useful. My voice goes softer. I find myself angling my body toward them like that's the most natural thing in the world.",

They orient toward the person they care about, closing distance by small degrees: a half-step nearer, a protective angle of the shoulders, a warmth in the face that doesn't ask permission.",
