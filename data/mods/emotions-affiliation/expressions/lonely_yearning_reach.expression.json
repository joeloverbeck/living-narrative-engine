    "actor_description": "I feel a quiet pull in my chest like my body is leaning toward someone who isn't here. My attention keeps snagging on the idea of closeness—messages unsent, names half-formed, a warmth I can almost touch. It hurts in a clean, persistent way, like a bruise pressed on purpose. I want to reach out, and the wanting is the sharpest part.",
    "description_text": "{actor} grows visibly tender and a little distant at the same time—gaze lingering, breath shallow, posture subtly angled as if listening for an answer. Their expression softens, but the softness looks like ache, not peace.",
