    "description": "Cynical detachment: an armored, bitter disbelief that stays sharp and evaluative—still engaged enough to judge, but refusing hope or sincerity.",
    "actor_description": "Everything in me goes flat in a precise way, like I’m putting on emotional gloves. My mind starts translating warmth into spin and effort into futility, and it feels almost protective. I’m not empty—I’m alert—but the lens is sour and dismissive. Even when something should matter, I can only find the angle where it doesn’t.",
    "description_text": "{actor} grows wry and guarded—eyes narrowing, mouth tightening into a faint, humorless half-smile. They stay engaged, but it reads like appraisal without buy-in: watchful, skeptical, hard to impress.",
