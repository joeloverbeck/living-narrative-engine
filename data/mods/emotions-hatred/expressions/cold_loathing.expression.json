  "description": "Enduring loathing: a steady, deliberate refusal of goodwill. The feeling isn’t a flare-up—it’s a settled stance, attention held on what disgusts or threatens the self, with a quiet certainty that the other should be kept out, diminished, or gone.",
  "category": "anger",
  "actor_description": "It isn’t heat—it’s clarity. My jaw sets and my mind goes still, like something in me has closed a door and thrown the bolt. I can think calmly about how to cut them out, how to deny them space, how to make sure they don’t touch my life again. There’s no grief in it, no softness—just a clean, cold no that keeps repeating.",
  "description_text": "{actor} goes unnervingly composed—eyes narrowed, mouth flat, movements economical. Their attention stays locked with a quiet, deliberate hostility, as if any warmth has been professionally withdrawn.",
