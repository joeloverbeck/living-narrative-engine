Suppresses competitive or devaluing blends (envy/jealousy/resentment/cynicism, contempt/disgust), prevents a self-collapsing humbling into shame/humiliation, and blocks high threat/hostility states (fear/anxiety/hypervigilance, rage/wrath/protest/moral outrage). Triggers only on a noticeable admiration/appreciation spike to avoid repeated firing during steady admiration."
