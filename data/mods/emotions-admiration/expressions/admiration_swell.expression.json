If the actor is very comforted (deeply soothed/held), require *strong* admiration to avoid the beat misreading a comforted-vulnerability moment as admiration. Suppresses competitive or devaluing blends (envy/jealousy/resentment/cynicism, contempt/disgust), prevents a self-collapsing humbling into shame/humiliation, and blocks high threat/hostility states (fear/anxiety/hypervigilance, rage/wrath/protest/moral outrage). Triggers only on a noticeable admiration/appreciation spike to avoid repeated firing during steady admiration."

Attention narrows to a point, sharp and generous at once. No hunger in it. No measuring myself against what I'm seeing. Just yes—recognition that lands warm and sure. My ribs expand around it. This matters. This is worth holding.",

Their face opens: eyebrows lift slightly, jaw unclenches. The quality of their stillness shifts from passive to magnetic, attention condensed to a single bright line.",
