    "description": "Cognitive overload stall: too many simultaneous threads—thinking stays online, but it starts to stutter. The mind keeps reaching for structure and coming up with noise, producing a visible pause-and-retry rhythm rather than detachment or panic.",

    "actor_description": "My thoughts keep grabbing for the next step and slipping like wet fingers. I’m still here—still trying—but everything arrives at once, and my brain starts dropping pieces mid-sentence. I blink too much, reread the same idea in my head, and feel my ability to choose a direction sag as if someone turned the dial down. I can’t tell what matters first, so I just… stall, stuck buffering while I try to get traction again.",
    "description_text": "{actor} goes briefly still in a way that reads like cognitive traffic, not absence—eyes tracking, jaw set, but responses arriving late or in restarted fragments. Their focus keeps re-aiming as if trying to prioritize, then catching and pausing again.",
