// Returns the target actor's body part entity IDs that are wounded (health below max).
//
// BEHAVIOR: Iterates target.body_parts via BodyGraphService#getAllParts and keeps
// parts with an anatomy:part_health component whose currentHealth is lower than
// maxHealth while excluding vital organs.
//
// IMPORTANT: Unlike wounded_target_body_parts.scope, this scope does NOT filter out
// covered wounds. This allows the action to target covered wounds (with a modifier
// penalty) so that LLM characters can be informed about wounds under clothing.
//
// Usage: Scope for treat_wounded_part action targeting another actor's wounds.
// Reference: specs/treat-wound-action.md
