# First-Aid Mod

Scaffolding for medical triage: future actions, conditions, rules, and scopes will live here to reason about wounded or bleeding body parts. Current content is empty by design to unblock manifest and validation wiring.

- Color scheme: Forest Green (4.1) — see `docs/mods/mod-color-schemes.md`.
- Reference: `specs/wounded-body-part-scoping.md` outlines the target scopes and predicates for wounded body part handling.
- Dependencies: `core`, `anatomy` (for body graphs and part health components).
