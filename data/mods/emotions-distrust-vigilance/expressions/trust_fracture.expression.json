    "description": "A sharp trust fracture: suspicion rises into a clear, chilling appraisal that someone or something is not safe to rely on. The shift is interpretive and decisive rather than explosive—attention narrows, warmth drains, and the body quietly reorients toward caution.",
    "category": "threat",
    "actor_description": "Oh. There it is—the hinge point. Something inside me clicks from \"maybe\" to \"not safe,\" and the warmth I was offering drains out like a pulled plug. I stay present, eyes sharp and busy, but my body stops leaning in; it starts measuring distance. I can feel my face go still, my voice flatten, my trust turning into a quiet, private ledger.",
    "description_text": "{actor} goes visibly cooler without raising their voice—eyes intent, expression tightening into a wary stillness. Their posture subtly angles away, as if creating distance while they keep reading every detail.",

Adds an optional cold edge (smoldering_anger or sufficiently negative valence) without allowing explosive hostility (caps rage/hatred) or acute fear collapse (caps panic/terror/freeze). Keeps release bounded so it doesn't read like relief. Fires only on suspicion/apprehension/threat/affiliation shifts or a smoldering rise to avoid steady-state distrust."
