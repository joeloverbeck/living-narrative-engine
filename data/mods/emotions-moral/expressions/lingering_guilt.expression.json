It doesn't flare up; it just sits in me, steady as a stone, and my mind keeps worrying it like a sore tooth. I catch myself editing imaginary conversations, rehearsing apologies I'll never deliver. My stomach stays tight; my throat feels crowded, like my body is trying to make me smaller in advance of judgment.",
  "description_text": "{actor} moves with a faint hesitation, as if checking their own right to occupy space. Their gaze slips away at the wrong moments; shoulders hold a quiet tension. Hands hover, fidget, then still—an awkwardness that reads less like fear and more like self-reproach.",
