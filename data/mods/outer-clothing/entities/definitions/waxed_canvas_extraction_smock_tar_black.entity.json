The thick fabric sheds water, slime, and the unspeakable fluids that seep from salvaged machinery. The sleeves are full and long, the hem falls to mid-thigh, and the whole garment reeks of the beeswax, tallow, and coal tar used to maintain its protective coating. A professional's garment for professional work."
