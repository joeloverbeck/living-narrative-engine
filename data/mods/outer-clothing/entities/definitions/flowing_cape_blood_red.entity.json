      "text": "A theatrical floor-length cape in intense blood-red that flows and billows with every movement. The sweeping fabric creates dramatic visual impact, its vivid color commanding attention in any setting. A secure clasp or tie closure at the neck allows the cape to drape elegantly over the shoulders and cascade down the back. This piece embodies pure gothic drama, transforming the wearer into a figure of theatrical presence whether worn over formal gowns or paired with simpler garments for instant gravitas."
