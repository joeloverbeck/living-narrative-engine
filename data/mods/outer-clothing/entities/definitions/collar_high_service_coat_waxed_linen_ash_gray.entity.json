      "text": "A formal service coat of waxed linen in muted ash-gray, its high collar standing stiff enough to brush the jawline. The wax treatment gives the fabric a subtle sheen and protection against damp, while the cut speaks to professional purpose—fitted through the torso, with sleeves that allow full range of motion. Brass buttons run in a double row down the front, each bearing a simple geometric pattern. This is the coat of someone who serves in an official capacity, designed to project quiet authority while remaining practical enough for actual work."
