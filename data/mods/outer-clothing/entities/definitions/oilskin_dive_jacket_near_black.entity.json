      "text": "A heavy jacket of waxed canvas in near-black, its surface gleaming with a fresh coat of linseed oil that catches the light in dark ribbons. The canvas is triple-layered across the shoulders and chest where pressure points would otherwise let water seep through, and the seams are sealed with tar and beeswax. The sleeves run long and tight at the wrists, designed to be tucked into gauntlets or bound with cord. When a diver descends into the murk, this jacket is what keeps the cold and the filth from seeping in—or at least, it does until the wax wears thin."
