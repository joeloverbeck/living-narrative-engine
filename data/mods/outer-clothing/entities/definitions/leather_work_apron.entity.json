      "text": "A thick leather work apron, tan-brown and marked with darker stains from years of tannery work. The heavy leather drapes from shoulders to mid-thigh, its surface telling decades of stories through chemical discoloration and wear patterns. The large front pocket bulges slightly with essential tools - a stitching awl, small knife, measuring tape - all kept within arm's reach. Reinforced stress points at the neck and waist show careful attention to durability, while the leather tie straps bear visible mending where they've been carefully stitched and re-stitched over time. Despite its age and the permanent staining that no amount of cleaning will remove, the apron is meticulously maintained - edges properly finished, tears promptly repaired, leather regularly oiled to prevent cracking. This isn't shabby or neglected workwear; it's the mark of a craftsman who respects his tools and takes pride in his profession. The apron carries the faint but persistent smell of tanning agents and leather oils, announcing its wearer's trade to anyone nearby. This is the garment of someone who might return to the workshop at any moment, who never fully stops being a leatherworker even when away from the bench."
