    "actor_description": "Something in me lets go—like I'd been holding my breath and only now notice it. The tight, suspicious edge drains away, replaced by a soft warmth that makes closeness feel safe again. I feel a small tug toward kindness—an urge to meet them gently, to rejoin the same side. It isn't euphoric; it's steadier than that, like the ground coming back under my feet.",
    "description_text": "{actor} visibly unbraces—shoulders easing, breath deepening, gaze less guarded. Their posture turns warmer and more open, as if the distance between them has become safe to cross again.",
