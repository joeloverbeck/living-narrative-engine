    "description": "Guard lowering: trust takes the wheel and the body stops bracing—softening into openness without tipping into helpless surrender.",
    "actor_description": "Something in me unclenches like I've been holding my breath for hours. My thoughts stop rehearsing worst-cases and start moving in longer, calmer lines. I feel my shoulders drop, my jaw loosen, and the urge to scan fades into a quiet willingness to be seen. It's not naïve—I just don't feel the need to armor every second.",
    "description_text": "{actor} visibly softens—posture easing, shoulders lowering, gaze less guarded. Their voice steadies and their attention stops darting, as if they've decided it's safe enough to be open for a moment.",

Triggers only on a trust spike, a meaningful threat drop, or a release crossing/spike to prevent spam."
