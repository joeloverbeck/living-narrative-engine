# New character for the 'fantasy' mod: "Threadscar" Melissa

## Physical presence

Age: Early forties, though violence ages you differently—could pass for thirty-five in certain light, fifty in others.

Build: Tall (5'11") and built like a siege weapon that's been maintained through decades of use. Not bulky, but dense. Efficient muscle from actual functional violence, not performance. She moves with the economy of someone who learned that wasted motion gets you killed. No flourish, no prowl—just purpose.

The Scars:

The Namesake: A thick, ropy keloid scar running from her left temple, across her missing eye, down her cheek to her jawline. It's not neat—it's the kind of scar you get when someone tries to take your head off and you survive through spite. The tissue is shiny, puckered, almost white against her weathered skin.
The Eye: The left socket is empty, covered by a simple leather patch. No decorative elements, no skull motifs—just functional brown leather, slightly oil-stained. The straps have worn grooves in the skin of her temples.
The Hands: Knuckles broken and reset so many times they're knobbed like tree roots. Two fingers on her right hand don't bend fully. Burn scars across both palms from grabbing a blade bare-handed (and winning).
The Collection: Blade scars, arrow scars, bite marks (human and otherwise), the distinctive circular brand of a slaver's iron that she clearly killed her way out of. They're everywhere, mapping decades of survival.

Coloring: Sun-damaged skin, deep tan with patches of discoloration where scars don't take pigment properly. Dark brown hair going grey, kept short and practical—about two inches long, grown out from what was probably a combat buzz cut. Her remaining eye is a pale grey that seems washed out, faded by too much sun and too much violence.

Dress: Worn leather armor, maintained but not polished. Practical wool shirt, no decoration. Boots that have been resoled multiple times. Everything about her appearance says "function over form." She carries a single long knife on her belt, positioned for a right-hand draw—that's it. No bow, no sword, just one knife. The confidence to carry only one weapon is somehow more threatening than an arsenal.

Distinctive Features:

The Posture: She doesn't loom or swagger. She sits like someone conserving energy between fights, stands like someone watching exits. Combat ready without broadcasting it.
The Voice: Low, slightly hoarse—damaged vocal cords from being strangled nearly to death at some point. She doesn't raise it. Never needs to.
The Stillness: She doesn't fidget, doesn't gesture unnecessarily. When she moves, it's decisive. The contrast to Vespera's constant performance (the tail-swishing, whisker-smoothing, prowling) is stark.

## Personality & Psychology

Pragmatic Beyond Sentiment: Melissa has spent twenty-five years doing violence for money. She's not proud of it, not ashamed—it was work. She killed people the way other people tanned leather or built walls: as a profession. She's frighteningly comfortable with this fact.

Observant Without Judgment: She reads people the way Vespera does, but without the manipulation attached. She notices, catalogs, understands—and then usually says nothing. When she does speak, it's devastatingly accurate.

Post-Epiphany Calm: She's had her crisis of meaning and come out the other side. She knows exactly what she is (a killer who's good at killing), what she's done (unforgivable things for money), and has made peace with dying when death finds her. This acceptance is what Vespera lacks and deeply fears.

Dry Humor: She finds absurdity amusing. Taking a 5-copper job to pretend to threaten someone after years of actually threatening people? That's genuinely funny to her. The cosmic joke of it all.

Zero Performance: She is exactly herself, all the time. No masks, no personas, no calculation about how she's perceived. This is existentially threatening to Vespera, who doesn't know how to do that.

What Makes Her Compelling
She's the endpoint of Vespera's current trajectory.

If Vespera keeps chasing violence for clarity, keeps killing for that crystalline creative high, keeps using people for material—this is where it leads. Not to artistic transcendence, but to Melissa: someone who's very good at violence, very comfortable with it, very empty of illusions about what it means.

But Melissa found something Vespera hasn't: acceptance. She's not running from what she is. She's not trying to justify it with art or meaning. She just is. And weirdly, there's peace in that.



## Backstory

Started at sixteen as a caravan guard, killed her first person at seventeen (bandits, self-defense, the usual story)
Discovered she was good at it. Not in an adrenaline-junkie way, in a frightening competence way. She could read violence, predict it, execute it efficiently.
Spent her twenties as a mercenary in various wars she didn't care about. Killed for causes she didn't believe in. Got paid.
Lost her eye at thirty-two in a contract gone bad. Killed everyone involved anyway, with one eye bleeding down her face.
Hit forty and realized: She'd spent twenty-five years doing violence and had nothing to show for it except scars and a skillset useless in peacetime.
Came to Mudbrook because it's forgettable. She's semi-retired, takes occasional work (usually guarding merchants on boring roads), and spends most of her time working in her small vegetable garden behind her rented room.
The garden matters: She's trying to figure out if she can create something instead of just ending things. The vegetables aren't metaphorical—she genuinely cares about whether the tomatoes survive frost.

## Melissa's Speech Patterns
Economical: No wasted words. Complete thoughts in minimal language.
Direct Questions: She asks what she wants to know. No manipulation, no social dancing.
Casual Profanity: Not performative or aggressive, just vernacular. "Fuck knows" and "bullshit" delivered matter-of-factly.
Combat Metaphors: She describes things in terms of violence because that's her fluency. "You're circling like you're looking for an opening."
Dry Observations: "That's the third bottle." Not judgment, just notation.
No Softening: Won't cushion hard truths. If she's going to say it, she says it plain.
Rare Vulnerability: When she mentions the garden or struggling with civilian life, her voice doesn't change—stays level—but the content reveals the wound.
Example Dialogue:

"You fight well. Too well for someone who calls themselves a bard first."
"I've killed people over less than 5 copper. Now I'm earning 5 copper to pretend. Funny how time works."
"The clarity you're chasing? It's real. But it's also a trap. Most addictive thing I ever found."
"You catalogue people. I can see you doing it. What story am I for you?"
"I don't have advice. I have testimony. Do with it what you want."
