# Action Effects DSL Transformation Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the potential transformation of the Living Narrative Engine's action effects system from its current JSON-based structure to an in-house Domain Specific Language (DSL), similar to the successfully implemented scopeDsl. The analysis examines technical, practical, and strategic considerations to determine whether this transformation would benefit the project.

## Current State: JSON-Based Action Effects System

### Overview
The current action effects system uses:
- **Rules**: JSON files with Event-Condition-Action (ECA) pattern
- **Operations**: 30+ discrete operation types with specific JSON schemas
- **Macros**: Reusable action sequences
- **Conditions**: JSON Logic expressions for conditional execution

### Example Current Syntax
```json
{
  "rule_id": "handle_follow",
  "event_type": "core:attempt_action",
  "condition": {
    "condition_ref": "core:event-is-action-follow"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "CHECK_FOLLOW_CYCLE",
      "parameters": {
        "follower_id": "{event.payload.actorId}",
        "leader_id": "{event.payload.targetId}",
        "result_variable": "cycleCheck"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "IF",
      "parameters": {
        "condition": {"var": "context.cycleCheck.cycleDetected"},
        "then_actions": [
          {"macro": "core:logFailureAndEndTurn"}
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Current Strengths
- **Strong validation**: JSON Schema provides comprehensive validation
- **IDE support**: Excellent autocomplete and error detection
- **Type safety**: Clear structure enforced by schemas
- **Explicit structure**: Every parameter clearly defined
- **Tool compatibility**: Works with standard JSON tooling

## DSL Transformation Vision

### Proposed DSL Syntax
Drawing inspiration from scopeDsl, an action effects DSL might look like:

```
// Rule definition
core:handle_follow := on core:attempt_action
  when core:event-is-action-follow
  do {
    cycleCheck = check_follow_cycle(actor, target)
    
    if cycleCheck.cycleDetected {
      targetName = get_name(target)
      log_failure("Cannot follow {targetName}; would create cycle")
      end_turn(false)
    } else {
      establish_follow(actor, target)
      followerName = get_name(actor)
      leaderName = get_name(target)
      
      dispatch_perceptible {
        location: actor.position.locationId
        text: "{followerName} is now following {leaderName}"
        type: action_target_general
      }
      
      end_turn(true)
    }
  }
```

### Alternative Syntax Approaches

#### Approach 1: Pipeline-Style
```
core:move_action := 
  on core:attempt_action[action="go"]
  | validate_components(actor, ["core:position", "core:name"])
  | get_target_location(event.targetId) -> targetLoc
  | move_entity(actor, targetLoc)
  | dispatch_event("entity_moved", {from: oldLoc, to: targetLoc})
  | end_turn(success: true)
```

#### Approach 2: Declarative with Effects
```
rule core:handle_follow {
  trigger: core:attempt_action
  guard: event.action == "follow"
  
  effects {
    check: no_follow_cycle(actor, target)
    modify: actor.components.core:following = target.id
    modify: target.components.core:followers += actor.id
    notify: perceptible_event("follow", actor, target)
    flow: end_turn(success)
  }
}
```

## Hybrid Approach Option

### Progressive Enhancement Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Support both JSON and DSL formats
2. **Phase 2**: DSL for new features only
3. **Phase 3**: Gradual migration of existing rules
4. **Phase 4**: Deprecate JSON support (optional)

### Benefits of Hybrid
- Lower risk migration
- Community can adopt gradually
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Test DSL with subset of features
- Fallback option available

## Recommendation

### Short-Term Recommendation: **Maintain JSON System**

**Rationale:**
1. Current system is functional and well-validated
2. Excellent tooling already in place
3. Low maintenance burden
4. Community familiarity
5. Development resources better spent on features

### Long-Term Consideration: **Revisit in 12-18 months**

**Conditions for DSL adoption:**
1. If action complexity significantly increases
2. If modder feedback indicates JSON is limiting
3. If scopeDsl proves highly successful
4. If dedicated resources available (3+ months)
5. If performance bottlenecks emerge in JSON parsing

### Alternative Improvements to Current System

Instead of full DSL transformation, consider:

1. **JSON Macros Enhancement**
   - More powerful macro system
   - Parameterized macros
   - Conditional macro expansion

2. **Schema Simplification**
   - Reduce boilerplate in common patterns
   - Smart defaults
   - Operation shortcuts

3. **Tooling Investment**
   - Visual rule editor
   - JSON validation improvements
   - Better error messages

4. **Hybrid Syntax Sugar**
   - Support simplified JSON notation
   - Optional shorthand for common operations
   - Template system for rules

## Conclusion

While a DSL transformation offers compelling benefits in readability and expressiveness, the current JSON-based system's strong validation, excellent tooling, and community familiarity make it the pragmatic choice for now. The implementation complexity and migration costs outweigh the benefits at this stage of the project.

The success of scopeDsl demonstrates the team's capability to implement effective DSLs, but action effects have different requirements that are well-served by JSON's structure and validation capabilities. Consider revisiting this decision when the action system's complexity grows or if modder feedback strongly indicates a need for more expressive syntax.

### Key Takeaway
**Focus on enhancing the current JSON system with better macros, tooling, and templates rather than undertaking a full DSL transformation at this time.**
