# New character for the 'fantasy' mod: Betram the Muddy

This is the man who has posted the request data/mods/fantasy/entities/definitions/notice_reciprocal_services.entity.json 

## Physical Description

Age: 53, looks every year of it without apology.

Build: Average height (5'8"), thick-bodied in the way of men who do physical labor but also enjoy beer. Not fat, not muscular—just solid. Working-man's build. Strong forearms and hands from leatherwork, slight belly from contentment.

The Perpetual Staining:

His skin has a permanent tan-brown tinge from decades of tannery work—the kind of discoloration that never fully washes out
Fingernails have dark crescents embedded in them (leather dyes, tannin stains)
Faint chemical smell that's not unpleasant, just present—leather, oils, the tang of curing agents
His hair and beard carry trace amounts of sawdust and color from dyes
Grooming: Clean, but not polished. He bathes regularly (mentioned in his posting: "hygiene acceptable") and his clothes are mended, laundered, functional. This isn't a slovenly man—he's just marked by his profession in ways that can't be scrubbed away. Everything about him says "I work with my hands and I'm fine with what that means."

Face: Weathered, unremarkable. Brown hair going grey, kept short and practical. Full beard, neatly trimmed. Warm brown eyes with smile-lines. The face of a man who's lived a satisfied life without drama. No hidden depths, no mysterious past—just a craftsman who's good at his work.

Hands: This is important. His hands are broad, strong, calloused in specific patterns from working leather. Nails short and practical. These are capable, honest hands that have crafted hundreds of useful items. When he mentions "all digits functional" in his posting, he means it literally—he's proud his hands still work perfectly after decades of labor.

Clothing: Leather apron over practical wool shirt and trousers, both stained from work but clean. Good boots he made himself. A simple belt with tools hanging from it. He dresses like someone who might need to go back to work at any moment.

Distinctive Feature: He smiles easily, makes eye contact naturally, and has absolutely zero shame in his body language. No nervousness, no leering, no performance. Just... present.

## Personality: The Man Without Subtext

Core Traits

Radically Sincere: Bertram means exactly what he says. There are no layers, no hidden agendas, no manipulation. When he posted that request, he meant it literally. He wants a handjob, he's willing to provide one in return, he views this as a fair trade. That's it. That's the whole thing.

Transactionally Healthy: He understands mutual benefit, fair exchange, and straightforward negotiation. He applies this to all aspects of life, including sexuality. This isn't cold or mechanical—it's just honest. He genuinely believes that if two people can help each other meet a need, why complicate it?

Comfortable in His Skin: Bertram is 53, looks 53, smells like a tannery, and is completely fine with all of this. He's not trying to be younger, more attractive, or different. He knows what he is (a skilled leatherworker, a decent man, someone who enjoys simple pleasures) and he's content.

No Existential Crisis: This is what makes him alien to Vespera. He doesn't wonder who he "really" is. He doesn't perform identity. He's just... Bertram. He makes leather goods, he drinks ale, he has needs, he meets them practically. Done.

Genuinely Kind: Not performatively nice—genuinely kind. He'll chat with anyone, remembers people's names, tips well, does good work for fair prices. He's a respected community member despite his unusual posting because everyone knows he's decent.

Matter-of-Fact About Sex: Bertram has a healthy libido but no romantic prospects (widower, set in his ways, not interested in courtship). He solved this problem the way he solves all problems: practically. He posted a request for mutual manual release services. Like posting for help moving furniture. Same energy.

## Backstory (Revealed Casually)

Married at 24 to his sweetheart Anna, a weaver. Happy marriage, genuinely compatible.
Anna died six years ago from winter fever. He mourned her properly, still misses her, has processed his grief like a healthy adult.
No interest in remarrying: He had his great love. It was good. It ended. He's grateful for what he had and not looking to replace her.
But he has needs: Physical ones. He's not ashamed of this. He considered visiting a brothel, decided that felt too impersonal. Considered courting, decided that implied promises he wasn't willing to make. Solution? Post for a straightforward exchange.
Respected craftsman: His leatherwork is genuinely excellent. Saddles, belts, boots, bags—all beautifully made, durable, fairly priced. Pride in his craft without pretension.
Simple pleasures: Good ale, watching the sunset while smoking his pipe, the smell of newly worked leather, a clean shop, occasional friendly sex with no strings attached. That's the whole list. He's happy.

## Speech Patterns

Direct and clear
Practically Metaphorical: Compares things to leatherwork naturally: "Like treating leather—you need the right pressure, proper care, attention to timing." "A good handjob is like good craftsmanship. You need to understand what you're working with, adjust to feedback, take pride in the result."

Casually Intimate: Talks about his dead wife with warm fondness but no dramatic grief. Discusses sexual preferences with the same comfort as discussing weather.

Sincerely Questioning: When he doesn't understand something, he asks. No ego about it.
