/**
 * @file Unit tests for traits generator runtime behavior
 * @description Original tests were based on incorrect assumptions about production code
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * The original test suite attempted to reproduce two runtime errors that don't actually exist:
 *
 * 1. "Missing getAllThematicDirections method" - This method exists in CharacterBuilderService
 * 2. "TraitsDisplayEnhancer constructor invocation error" - The class is properly instantiated with 'new'
 *
 * These tests have been replaced with a placeholder to document this finding.
