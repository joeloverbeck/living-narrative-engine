# Archived Tests

This directory contains historical tests that are no longer actively maintained or executed.

## Purpose

Tests are archived rather than deleted to:

- Preserve historical context and testing approaches
- Allow reference for similar future testing needs
- Maintain a record of what was tested and why it changed
- Enable resurrection if the testing approach becomes relevant again

## Files

### activityDescriptionService.characterization.test.js

**Original Purpose**: Characterization test for the activity description service.

**Why Archived**: This test approach was superseded by more comprehensive integration tests that better capture the service's behavior and interactions with other systems.

**Date Archived**: [Original archival date not recorded]

## Guidelines

**Do Not**:

- Run these tests as part of automated test suites
- Expect these tests to pass without modification
- Use as examples of current best practices

**Do**:

- Reference for historical context
- Use as inspiration for new testing approaches
- Review before deleting to understand testing history

## Adding to Archive

When archiving a test:

1. Move the test file to this directory
2. Update this README with:
   - File name
   - Original purpose
   - Reason for archival
   - Date archived
3. Ensure the test is not referenced in any test runners
