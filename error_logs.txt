Root Cause Analysis

  The issue was not in the test suites but in the System Under Test (SUT). Recent changes to the action discovery pipeline fundamentally altered the action formatting behavior:

  - Before: Generated separate actions for each target (2 targets → 2 actions)
  - After: Generates one action with all targets in a targets array (2 targets → 1 action with targets array)

  Changes Made

  Updated test expectations in 5 test files to match the new SUT behavior:

  1. actionDiscoveryService.tracing.test.js: Updated expected action count from 2 → 1
  2. actionCandidateProcessor.test.js: Updated to expect 1 action with targets array instead of 2 separate actions
  3. actionDiscoveryService.processActionDefinition.test.js: Added expected targets array to action object
  4. actionDiscoverySystem.go.test.js: Added expected targets array to go action
  5. actionDiscoveryService.locationRetrieval.test.js: Updated to expect 1 go action with 2 targets instead of 2 separate go actions
