### 4.1 Test Structure Template

```javascript
describe('[Workflow Name] E2E', () => {
  // Comprehensive setup using facades
  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Use createMockFacades pattern
    // Initialize test environment
  });

  describe('Core Functionality', () => {
    // Primary workflow tests
  });

  describe('Edge Cases', () => {
    // Boundary condition tests
  });

  describe('Performance', () => {
    // Performance validation tests
  });

  describe('Error Scenarios', () => {
    // Error handling tests
  });
});
```

### 4.2 Key Testing Patterns to Follow

1. Use the facade pattern (as seen in recent test migrations)
2. Leverage `turnExecutionFacade` for comprehensive testing
3. Include performance benchmarks in critical paths
4. Always test error scenarios and recovery
5. Validate both positive and negative cases

### 4.3 Metrics for Success

- All Priority 1 tests implemented within 2 weeks
- 90%+ code coverage for action pipeline
- Performance benchmarks established
- No regression in existing functionality

## 5. Conclusion

The action pipeline has solid foundational e2e test coverage, particularly for basic workflows and edge cases. However, critical gaps exist in concurrent execution, complex side effects, and performance testing. Implementing the recommended test suites in priority order will significantly improve system reliability and catch issues before they reach production.

The most urgent need is for multi-actor concurrent action testing and complex side effect propagation validation, as these represent the highest risk areas for production issues.
