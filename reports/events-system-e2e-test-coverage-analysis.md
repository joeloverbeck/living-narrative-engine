## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

The events system consists of four main components in a layered architecture:

```
Application Layer
     ↓
SafeEventDispatcher (Error handling & logging)
     ↓
ValidatedEventDispatcher (Schema validation)
     ↓
EventBus (Core pub/sub mechanism)
     ↓
EventDispatchTracer (Monitoring & tracing)
```

### Key Files

- **`src/events/eventBus.js`**: Core event bus with pub/sub, recursion prevention, batch mode
- **`src/events/validatedEventDispatcher.js`**: Schema validation layer for event payloads
- **`src/events/safeEventDispatcher.js`**: Error handling wrapper preventing exceptions
- **`src/events/tracing/eventDispatchTracer.js`**: Event tracing and monitoring

## Identified Workflows

### 1. Basic Event Dispatch Workflow
```
Component → dispatch(event) → SafeEventDispatcher → ValidatedEventDispatcher → EventBus → Listeners
```
- **Purpose**: Standard event publishing with validation and error handling
- **Used By**: All components that emit events
- **Critical Events**: `core:component_added`, `core:component_removed`, `core:entity_created`

### 2. Batch Mode Workflow
```
GameEngine → setBatchMode(true) → EventBus → Adjusted recursion limits → Bulk operations → setBatchMode(false)
```
- **Purpose**: Handle high-volume events during game initialization
- **Context**: Loading saved games, initializing large entity sets
- **Configuration**: 
  - Default limits: 10 recursion depth, 25 global recursion
  - Customizable via `maxRecursionDepth` and `maxGlobalRecursion` options
  - Higher limits for workflow events (25 depth) and component lifecycle (100 depth)
- **Safety**: Auto-timeout after 30 seconds (configurable via `timeoutMs`)

### 3. Recursion Prevention Workflow
```
Event A → Handler → Event B → Handler → Event A (blocked at depth limit)
```
- **Purpose**: Prevent infinite loops and stack overflow
- **Limits** (dynamically determined by event type): 
  - Normal mode:
    - Standard events: 10 depth per event, 200 global
    - Workflow events: 20 depth per event, 200 global
    - Component lifecycle: 100 depth (special case)
  - Batch mode (configurable):
    - Default: 10 depth, 25 global
    - Workflow events: 25 depth
    - Component lifecycle: 100 depth
    - Can be customized via `maxRecursionDepth` and `maxGlobalRecursion` options

### 4. Wildcard Subscription Workflow
```
subscribe('*', handler) → Receives ALL events → Universal monitoring/logging
```
- **Purpose**: Global event monitoring, debugging, analytics
- **Use Cases**: Alert router, system monitoring, debug logging

### 5. Error Event Workflow
```
Error occurs → dispatch('core:system_error_occurred') → SafeEventDispatcher (console logging) → Alert system
```
- **Purpose**: Error reporting without recursion
- **Special Handling**: Uses console.error to prevent logger recursion

### 6. Turn Management Workflow  
```
TurnManager → dispatch('core:turn_started') → Actor handlers → dispatch('core:turn_ended') → Next turn
```
- **Purpose**: Game turn lifecycle management
- **Events**: `turn_started`, `turn_processing_started`, `turn_processing_ended`, `turn_ended`, `player_turn_prompt`, `action_decided`, `attempt_action`
- **Special Handling**: Workflow events receive elevated recursion limits (20 in normal mode, 25 in batch mode) to allow legitimate game loops
- **Event Classification**: These are classified as "workflow events" and tracked separately from standard events

### 7. Component Mutation Workflow
```
Various Systems → Component operations → dispatch('core:component_added') → Systems react
```
- **Purpose**: Entity component lifecycle notifications
- **Events**: `core:component_added`, `core:component_removed`
- **Note**: Component events are dispatched by multiple systems throughout the codebase, not just ComponentMutationService
- **Special Handling**: Component lifecycle events have elevated recursion limits (100) to handle deep component hierarchies

### 8. Validation Failure Workflow
```
dispatch(invalid_event) → ValidatedEventDispatcher → Schema validation fails → Log error → Block dispatch
```
- **Purpose**: Prevent invalid events from propagating
- **Validation Process** (✅ VERIFIED ACCURATE):
  - ValidatedEventDispatcher checks event against loaded schemas from GameDataRepository
  - Uses AJV-based SchemaValidator for JSON Schema validation
  - Returns validation result with detailed error messages if validation fails
  - Special handling for bootstrap events (system_error_occurred) during initialization
- **Outcome**: Event blocked (returns false), error logged with schema validation details including field paths

### 9. Event Tracing Workflow
```
Event dispatch → EventDispatchTracer → Create trace → Capture timing → Write to storage
```
- **Purpose**: Performance monitoring and debugging
- **Data**: Event name, payload, timing, success/failure

### 10. Initialization Bootstrap Workflow
```
System startup → Bootstrap events (before schemas loaded) → Special handling → Normal operation
```
- **Purpose**: Handle critical events during system initialization
- **Special Events**: `core:system_error_occurred`, `core:critical_notification_shown`
- **Bootstrap Handling**: 
  - These events can be dispatched before schemas are fully loaded
  - ValidatedEventDispatcher has special logic to allow these events through without validation
  - Ensures error reporting works even during early initialization phases

## Implementation Guidelines

### Test Structure Template

```javascript
/**
 * @file [TestName].e2e.test.js
 * @description End-to-end test for [workflow description]
 */

import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach, afterEach } from '@jest/globals';
import { EventSystemTestBed } from '../common/eventSystemTestBed.js';

describe('[Workflow Name] E2E', () => {
  let testBed;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    testBed = new EventSystemTestBed();
    await testBed.initialize();
  });

  afterEach(async () => {
    await testBed.cleanup();
  });

  describe('[Scenario]', () => {
    it('should [expected behavior]', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const events = await testBed.setupScenario();
      
      // Act
      const result = await testBed.executeWorkflow();
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toMatchExpectedBehavior();
      await testBed.verifyEventSequence();
      await testBed.verifySystemState();
    });
  });
});
```

### Common Test Bed Requirements

Create `tests/e2e/events/common/eventSystemTestBed.js`:

```javascript
import { IntegrationTestBed } from '../../../common/integrationTestBed.js';

export class EventSystemTestBed extends IntegrationTestBed {
  async initialize() {
    await super.initialize();
    // Additional event-specific setup
    // Setup event monitoring and tracing
  }

  async setupScenario() {
    // Create test entities
    // Configure event handlers
    // Setup expected behaviors
  }

  async executeWorkflow() {
    // Trigger workflow
    // Capture events
    // Record timing
  }

  async verifyEventSequence() {
    // Check event order
    // Validate payloads
    // Verify handler execution
  }

  async cleanup() {
    // Remove listeners
    // Clear state
    await super.cleanup();
  }
}
```

**Note**: Leverage existing test bed infrastructure from `tests/common/` including:
- `IntegrationTestBed` for full DI container setup
- `BaseTestBed` for common test utilities
- Other specialized test beds as reference patterns

### Testing Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent
2. **Determinism**: Tests must be reproducible
3. **Timing**: Use proper async/await patterns
4. **Validation**: Check both positive and negative cases
5. **Documentation**: Clear descriptions of what's being tested
6. **Performance**: Keep tests fast (< 5 seconds each)

## Process Improvement Recommendations

### Report Accuracy Validation

To prevent future discrepancies between reports and actual codebase state:

1. **Pre-Report Verification Process**
   - Always run file system searches before claiming files don't exist
   - Use `find` and `grep` commands to verify current implementation status
   - Cross-reference with actual test directories and file contents

2. **Implementation Status Verification Commands**
   ```bash
   # Verify E2E test coverage

3. **Regular Report Validation**
   - Schedule quarterly report accuracy reviews
   - Validate implementation claims against actual codebase
   - Update reports when new tests are implemented
   - Maintain a test inventory with actual file paths and line counts

4. **Documentation Standards**
   - Include file paths and line counts for all claimed implementations
   - Use verification status indicators (✅ IMPLEMENTED, ❓ NEEDS_VERIFICATION, ❌ MISSING)
   - Document the verification date and method used
   - Include cross-references to related tests when applicable

### NEEDS_VERIFICATION Sections - Verification Complete ✅

**Verification Process Conducted**: 2025-09-12
**Method**: Direct codebase analysis, file inspection, and implementation verification

#### Verification Results Summary

**✅ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (Enhanced):**
1. **Recursion Prevention** - Basic recursion protection confirmed in `completeEventLifecycle.e2e.test.js` (lines 455-478)
   - Console fallback mechanism verified in `SafeEventDispatcher.js`
   - Batch mode recursion configuration testing confirmed
   - Advanced scenarios still need dedicated testing

2. **Error Event Handling** - Basic error handling confirmed in `completeEventLifecycle.e2e.test.js` (lines 415-453)
   - Console fallback mechanism fully verified with error recursion detection
   - Handler failure recovery testing confirmed
   - Advanced error propagation scenarios still need testing

**❌ MISSING (Clarified Status):**
3. **Turn Management Event Flow** - Turn tests exist but lack event-specific validation
   - Existing: `FullTurnExecution.e2e.test.js`, `TurnBasedActionProcessing.e2e.test.js`
   - Gap: No TURN_STARTED → TURN_ENDED event sequence validation found

4. **Multi-System Event Cascade** - Cross-system tests exist but lack cascade-focused testing
   - Existing: Various multi-target and cross-mod integration tests
   - Gap: No event cascade flow validation across system boundaries found

**Previously Verified as Implemented:**
- ✅ **BatchModeGameLoading.e2e.test.js** (554 lines) - Comprehensive batch mode testing
- ✅ **ComponentMutationWorkflow.e2e.test.js** - Component mutation event testing  
- ✅ **ActionExecutionTracing.e2e.test.js** - Event tracing integration testing
- ✅ **Wildcard subscription testing** - Covered in completeEventLifecycle.e2e.test.js

**Recently Implemented (September 12, 2025):**
- ✅ **ErrorEventHandlingAdvanced.e2e.test.js** (371 lines) - Complete advanced error event handling testing
