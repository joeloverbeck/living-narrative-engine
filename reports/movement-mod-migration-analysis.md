# Movement Mod Migration Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis and migration plan for extracting movement-related functionality from the `core` mod into the dedicated `movement` mod. The migration involves transferring 6 files containing movement-specific actions, rules, conditions, and scopes while maintaining system integrity and updating visual properties to align with the mod's thematic identity.

**Key Objectives:**
- Achieve clean separation of movement mechanics from core functionality
- Update visual styling to use Explorer Cyan color scheme
- Maintain backward compatibility and system stability
- Establish the movement mod as the authoritative source for navigation mechanics

**Report Status:** Updated based on codebase analysis to include positioning mod dependencies and phased migration recommendations.

## Detailed Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Preparation

1. **Create Directory Structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p data/mods/movement/actions
   mkdir -p data/mods/movement/rules
   mkdir -p data/mods/movement/conditions
   mkdir -p data/mods/movement/scopes
   ```

2. **Backup Current Files**
   ```bash
   cp -r data/mods/core/actions/go.action.json data/mods/core/actions/go.action.json.backup
   cp -r data/mods/core/rules/go.rule.json data/mods/core/rules/go.rule.json.backup
   # ... repeat for all files
   ```

### Phase 2: File Migration and Modification

#### Step 1: Migrate go.action.json
1. Copy file to movement mod:
   ```bash
   cp data/mods/core/actions/go.action.json data/mods/movement/actions/
   ```

2. Update the file with the following changes:
   - Change `"id": "core:go"` to `"id": "movement:go"`
   - Update scope reference from `"core:clear_directions"` to `"movement:clear_directions"`
   - Update prerequisite condition from `"core:actor-can-move"` to `"movement:actor-can-move"`
   - Replace entire visual section with Explorer Cyan colors

#### Step 2: Migrate go.rule.json
1. Copy file to movement mod:
   ```bash
   cp data/mods/core/rules/go.rule.json data/mods/movement/rules/
   ```

2. Update the file with the following changes:
   - Change `"condition_ref": "core:event-is-action-go"` to `"movement:event-is-action-go"`
   - Update all internal references to use `movement:` namespace

#### Step 3: Migrate Conditions
1. Copy all condition files:
   ```bash
   cp data/mods/core/conditions/event-is-action-go.condition.json data/mods/movement/conditions/
   cp data/mods/core/conditions/actor-can-move.condition.json data/mods/movement/conditions/
   cp data/mods/core/conditions/exit-is-unblocked.condition.json data/mods/movement/conditions/
   ```

2. Update each condition file:
   - Change all `"id": "core:*"` to `"id": "movement:*"`
   - In `event-is-action-go.condition.json`, update the logic to check for `"movement:go"` instead of `"core:go"`

#### Step 4: Migrate Scope
1. Copy scope file:
   ```bash
   cp data/mods/core/scopes/clear_directions.scope data/mods/movement/scopes/
   ```

2. Update the scope definition:
   - Change `core:clear_directions` to `movement:clear_directions`
   - Update condition reference from `"core:exit-is-unblocked"` to `"movement:exit-is-unblocked"`

### Phase 3: Update Manifests

#### Update movement/mod-manifest.json
```json
{
  "$schema": "http://example.com/schemas/mod-manifest.schema.json",
  "id": "movement",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "Movement System",
  "description": "Provides core movement mechanics including navigation, pathfinding, and spatial transitions.",
  "author": "joeloverbeck",
  "gameVersion": ">=0.0.1",
  "dependencies": ["core"],
  "content": {
    "actions": [
      "movement:go"
    ],
    "rules": [
      "handle_go_action"
    ],
    "conditions": [
      "movement:event-is-action-go",
      "movement:actor-can-move",
      "movement:exit-is-unblocked"
    ],
    "scopes": [
      "movement:clear_directions"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Update core/mod-manifest.json
Remove the migrated content from the core manifest's content section.

### Phase 4: Update Cross-References

#### Files in Core Mod Requiring Updates

1. **`events/player_turn_prompt.event.json`**
   - If it references `core:go`, update to `movement:go`

2. **`actions/follow.action.json`**
   - Update prerequisite from `"core:actor-can-move"` to `"movement:actor-can-move"`

3. Any other files that reference the migrated components

### Phase 5: Cleanup

1. **Remove Original Files from Core**
   ```bash
   rm data/mods/core/actions/go.action.json
   rm data/mods/core/rules/go.rule.json
   rm data/mods/core/conditions/event-is-action-go.condition.json
   rm data/mods/core/conditions/actor-can-move.condition.json
   rm data/mods/core/conditions/exit-is-unblocked.condition.json
   rm data/mods/core/scopes/clear_directions.scope
   ```

2. **Remove Backup Files** (after verification)
   ```bash
   rm data/mods/core/actions/go.action.json.backup
   # ... repeat for all backup files
   ```

## Dependency Analysis

### Direct Dependencies

#### Files That Reference Movement Components
- **`core/actions/follow.action.json`**
  - References: `core:actor-can-move`
  - Action Required: Update to `movement:actor-can-move`

#### Additional Mod Dependencies
- **`positioning/actions/turn_around.action.json`**
  - References: `core:actor-can-move`
  - Action Required: Update to `movement:actor-can-move`

- **`positioning/actions/get_close.action.json`**
  - References: `core:actor-can-move`
  - Action Required: Update to `movement:actor-can-move`

#### Mod Dependencies
- **Movement mod depends on:**
  - `core` (for basic entities, components, and events)

- **Mods that will depend on movement:**
  - `positioning` (for movement validation in spatial interactions)
  - Any future mods implementing travel, navigation, or spatial mechanics

### Impact Assessment

#### Low Risk
- Scope migration (self-contained)
- Condition migrations (clear references)

#### Medium Risk
- Action migration (UI visibility changes due to color update)
- Rule migration (event handling chain)

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Maintain backward compatibility aliases during transition
- Implement comprehensive testing before removal
- Document all changes in changelog

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Plan
1. Keep backup files for at least one release cycle
2. Maintain compatibility layer if needed:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "core:go",
     "redirect": "movement:go"
   }
   ```
3. Document all changes in release notes

### Compatibility Considerations
- Consider implementing a deprecation period
- Log warnings for old namespace usage
- Provide migration guide for mod developers

### Cross-Mod Compatibility
- The positioning mod depends on `core:actor-can-move`
- Must be updated alongside the migration or immediately after
- Consider temporary compatibility aliases during transition period to prevent breaking changes
- Implement version constraints to ensure proper dependency resolution

## Future Considerations

### Potential Movement Mod Enhancements
1. **Advanced Navigation**
   - Pathfinding algorithms
   - Movement costs
   - Terrain types

2. **Movement Modifiers**
   - Speed variations
   - Movement restrictions
   - Special movement modes (flying, swimming)

3. **Spatial Awareness**
   - Distance calculations
   - Line of sight
   - Area of effect movements

### Related Mod Opportunities
- **positioning** - Already exists, could integrate
- **vehicles** - Future mod for mounted/vehicle movement
- **teleportation** - Magical movement systems

## Recommendations for Migration

### Phased Migration Approach
1. **Phase 1: Parallel Implementation**
   - Deploy movement mod with new namespace
   - Keep core mod components temporarily
   - Add deprecation warnings to core components

2. **Phase 2: Compatibility Aliases**
   - Implement redirect aliases from `core:*` to `movement:*`
   - Update dependent mods (positioning, follow action)
   - Monitor for any custom mods using these components

3. **Phase 3: Cleanup**
   - Remove core mod movement components
   - Remove compatibility aliases
   - Update documentation

### Version Management
- Movement mod should specify version 1.0.0 for initial migration
- Core mod should bump to next minor version
- Positioning mod should update dependencies to require movement >=1.0.0

### Migration Tooling
- Create automated migration script to update all references
- Include positioning mod updates in the script
- Provide rollback capability for safety

### Developer Communication
- Announce migration plan in advance
- Provide migration guide for custom mod developers
- Document breaking changes clearly in changelog

## Conclusion

The migration of movement-related functionality from the core mod to the dedicated movement mod represents a significant architectural improvement. This separation of concerns will:

1. **Improve Maintainability** - Movement logic is centralized
2. **Enable Specialization** - Movement mod can evolve independently
3. **Enhance Modularity** - Clear boundaries between core and movement
4. **Support Extensibility** - Easier to add movement features

The use of Explorer Cyan color scheme reinforces the thematic identity of exploration and spatial navigation, while maintaining WCAG compliance for accessibility.

**Important Note**: The positioning mod dependency on `core:actor-can-move` must be addressed during migration to prevent runtime errors. A phased approach with compatibility aliases is recommended for smooth transition.
