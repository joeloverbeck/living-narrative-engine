# LLM Character Thoughts/Action Sequence Analysis Report

**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Issue ID**: Thoughts/Action Temporal Sequencing  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Analysis Complete, Solution Proposed

## Executive Summary

The Living Narrative Engine's character AI system has a critical issue where LLMs generate **predictive thoughts** that assume action outcomes rather than generating thoughts that are **temporally prior** to action execution. This breaks immersion by having characters "know" results before actions occur.

## Problem Description

### Current Behavior (Problematic)

When an LLM-controlled character decides to perform an action (e.g., "hug"), the generated thoughts often include assumptions about the action's outcome:

**Example**:

- **Chosen Action**: `hug`
- **Generated Thought**: "He's accepting my hug, I can feel his warmth"
- **Problem**: The character "knows" the hug was accepted before performing it

### Expected Behavior

Thoughts should reflect the character's mental state **immediately before** action execution, without knowledge of outcomes:

**Corrected Example**:

- **Chosen Action**: `hug`
- **Expected Thought**: "I want to comfort him with a hug, I hope he won't pull away"
- **Correct**: Expresses intention/motivation without assuming results

## Architecture Analysis

### Current Prompt Construction System

The Living Narrative Engine uses a sophisticated prompt assembly system located in `src/prompting/`:

```
Game Logic ‚Üí AIPromptContentProvider ‚Üí PromptDataFormatter ‚Üí CharacterPromptTemplate
```

#### Key Components

1. **Character Prompt Template** (`src/prompting/templates/characterPromptTemplate.js`)
   - Defines overall prompt structure with placeholders
   - Uses `{thoughtsVoiceGuidance}` and `{thoughtsSection}` placeholders

2. **Prompt Data Formatter** (`src/prompting/promptDataFormatter.js`)
   - Formats complex data into strings for template substitution
   - Contains `formatThoughtsVoiceGuidance()` and `formatThoughtsSection()` methods
   - **Critical**: Currently lacks temporal sequencing instructions

3. **Core Prompt Instructions** (`data/prompts/corePromptText.json`)
   - Contains fundamental character portrayal guidelines
   - Includes task definition and content policy
   - Missing specific thought/action timing guidance

4. **LLM Response Schema** (`src/turns/schemas/llmOutputSchemas.js`)
   - Defines expected JSON structure: `{chosenIndex, speech, thoughts}`
   - Schema is correct but doesn't enforce semantic timing rules

### Current Instruction Analysis

#### Current Thought Guidance Implementation (ALREADY ENHANCED)

```javascript
// Current voice guidance in production (formatThoughtsVoiceGuidance - lines 413-418)
"INNER VOICE GUIDANCE: Your thoughts must be fresh and unique - do not repeat or barely rephrase the previous thoughts shown above. Build upon your existing mental state with new insights, reactions, or perspectives that authentically reflect your character's unique mental voice, personality patterns, and internal speech style. CRITICAL: Generate thoughts that occur IMMEDIATELY BEFORE performing your chosen action - you do NOT know what will happen as a result of your action yet. Do not assume outcomes, reactions, or results. Think about your intentions and reasoning for the action, not its anticipated effects.";

// Current thoughts section guidance in production (formatThoughtsSection - lines 399-405)
"Generate a fresh, unique thought that builds upon your mental state. Your thought should reflect what you're thinking RIGHT BEFORE taking your chosen action - focus on your intentions, motivations, or reasoning, NOT on anticipated outcomes or results.";
```

#### ‚úÖ Critical Elements ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

1. **‚úÖ Temporal sequencing instruction**: "IMMEDIATELY BEFORE performing your chosen action"
2. **‚úÖ Explicit prohibition of predictive thoughts**: "you do NOT know what will happen as a result"
3. **‚úÖ Guidance about action outcome assumptions**: "Do not assume outcomes, reactions, or results"
4. **‚úÖ Instruction about pre-action mental state**: "focus on your intentions, motivations, or reasoning"

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause (ADDRESSED)

**‚úÖ RESOLVED**: Insufficient prompt specification regarding the temporal relationship between thoughts and actions has been addressed through enhanced prompt instructions in production code.

### Contributing Factors (STATUS UPDATE)

1. **LLM Training Bias**: LLMs naturally complete narratives, including outcomes _(ongoing challenge - addressed via explicit instructions)_
2. **‚úÖ RESOLVED - Lack of Explicit Constraints**: Now includes clear instruction preventing predictive thoughts
3. **‚úÖ RESOLVED - Missing Context**: LLMs now explicitly understand they're generating pre-action thoughts
4. **Narrative Completion Tendency**: LLMs want to complete story arcs within responses _(ongoing challenge - mitigated via constraints)_

### Why This Matters

1. **Immersion Breaking**: Characters appear omniscient about action results
2. **Narrative Inconsistency**: Actions may fail despite confident thoughts
3. **Character Authenticity**: Reduces believability of AI characters
4. **Player Experience**: Undermines suspension of disbelief

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED SOLUTION

### Current Implementation Status

The temporal sequencing solution has been **successfully implemented and deployed** in the production codebase:

#### ‚úÖ Enhanced Voice Guidance (COMPLETE)

Current implementation in `formatThoughtsVoiceGuidance()` (lines 413-418):

```javascript
// CURRENT PRODUCTION CODE
return "INNER VOICE GUIDANCE: Your thoughts must be fresh and unique - do not repeat or barely rephrase the previous thoughts shown above. Build upon your existing mental state with new insights, reactions, or perspectives that authentically reflect your character's unique mental voice, personality patterns, and internal speech style. CRITICAL: Generate thoughts that occur IMMEDIATELY BEFORE performing your chosen action - you do NOT know what will happen as a result of your action yet. Do not assume outcomes, reactions, or results. Think about your intentions and reasoning for the action, not its anticipated effects.";
```

#### ‚úÖ Enhanced Thoughts Section (COMPLETE)

Current implementation in `formatThoughtsSection()` (lines 399-405):

```javascript
// CURRENT PRODUCTION CODE
return `<thoughts>
Recent thoughts (avoid repeating or barely rephrasing these):
${content}

Generate a fresh, unique thought that builds upon your mental state. Your thought should reflect what you're thinking RIGHT BEFORE taking your chosen action - focus on your intentions, motivations, or reasoning, NOT on anticipated outcomes or results.
</thoughts>`;
```

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Explicit Instruction**: Clear prohibition of predictive thoughts
2. **Positive Guidance**: Tells LLM what TO think about (intentions, motivations)
3. **Temporal Clarity**: Establishes clear timing relationship
4. **Minimal System Impact**: Changes only prompt formatting, no architectural changes
5. **Backward Compatible**: Doesn't break existing functionality
