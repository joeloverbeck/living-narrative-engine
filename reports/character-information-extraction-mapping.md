# Character Information Extraction Mapping Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines how information from character component files (like `spencer_hawthorne.character.json`) should be systematically extracted into individual note entries using the `core:notes` component structure. The goal is to optimize character information for AI accessibility during gameplay by creating granular, well-categorized notes with appropriate subject types.

## Available Subject Types

The `core:notes` component supports 17 subject types for categorization:

- **character** - References to other characters, NPCs, or entities
- **location** - Places, venues, geographical areas
- **item** - Objects, possessions, artifacts
- **creature** - Animals, monsters, non-character entities
- **event** - Happenings, incidents, occasions
- **concept** - Abstract ideas, principles, philosophies
- **relationship** - Connections between entities, social bonds
- **organization** - Groups, institutions, factions
- **quest** - Goals, missions, objectives
- **skill** - Abilities, competencies, talents
- **emotion** - Feelings, affective states
- **plan** - Strategies, intentions, schemes
- **timeline** - Temporal sequences, schedules
- **theory** - Beliefs, hypotheses, worldviews
- **observation** - Perceptions, noticed details
- **knowledge_state** - What is known/unknown about something
- **psychological_state** - Mental/emotional conditions
- **other** - Miscellaneous or multi-category information

## Component-by-Component Extraction Mapping

### 1. `core:profile` Component

**Component Purpose**: Biographical narrative and character background

**Extraction Strategy**: Parse into thematic segments focusing on extractable facts and relationships

**Recommended Extractions**:

#### A. Basic Demographics & Identity
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer Hawthorne, 55-year-old American from Chicago, currently living in Donostia, Spain",
  "subject": "myself",
  "subjectType": "character",
  "context": "basic identity"
}
```

#### B. Professional History
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer studied law and became a persuasive lawyer, rising through the ranks before becoming CEO of an international law firm",
  "subject": "my career",
  "subjectType": "timeline",
  "context": "professional development"
}
```

#### C. Family Relationships
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer married Madeleine, who later cheated and blamed his controlling ways. They have a daughter Makenzie who is spoiled and vapid",
  "subject": "Madeleine and Makenzie",
  "subjectType": "relationship",
  "context": "family history"
}
```

```json
{
  "text": "Makenzie is engaged to Jon Itxasondo, a local 19-year-old man. She lives on her own in an apartment",
  "subject": "Makenzie Hawthorne",
  "subjectType": "character",
  "context": "my daughter"
}
```

#### D. Relationship with Jon (Key Pattern)
```json
{
  "text": "Jon Itxasondo is Makenzie's 19-year-old fiancé, whom Spencer initially viewed as weak and submissive",
  "subject": "Jon Itxasondo",
  "subjectType": "character",
  "context": "my daughter's fiancé"
}
```

```json
{
  "text": "Spencer has been sexually involved with Jon for the past year, coercing him through financial pressure and blackmail threats",
  "subject": "Jon Itxasondo",
  "subjectType": "relationship",
  "context": "secret sexual relationship"
}
```

```json
{
  "text": "The year-long exploitation of Jon has created Spencer's most sustained intimate relationship, with more psychological knowledge than his marriage held",
  "subject": "Jon Itxasondo",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state",
  "context": "inadvertent emotional attachment"
}
```

#### E. Living Situation
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer lives in a villa in the hills of Donostia with views of the bay",
  "subject": "my villa",
  "subjectType": "location",
  "context": "current residence"
}
```

#### F. Key Events & Turning Points
```json
{
  "text": "The sauna encounter where Spencer first coerced Jon into oral sex was a revelation about dominating male heterosexual identity",
  "subject": "sauna incident with Jon",
  "subjectType": "event",
  "context": "sexual awakening discovery"
}
```

#### G. Physical Appearance
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer is tall with partial gray hair, a prominent gut he displays without shame, angular face with deep nasolabial folds, often wears expensive musky cologne",
  "subject": "my appearance",
  "subjectType": "observation",
  "context": "physical description"
}
```

**Rationale**: Profile text is densely packed with multiple information types. Breaking into specific subject types (character refs, relationships, events, locations) makes each fact independently accessible to AI during play.

---

### 2. `core:personality` Component

**Component Purpose**: Psychological patterns, behavioral tendencies, core traits

**Extraction Strategy**: Identify distinct personality mechanisms and psychological patterns

**Recommended Extractions**:

#### A. Core Behavioral Patterns
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer orchestrates elaborate preludes to violation with rituals (robe, villa staging, psychological foreplay) because he experiences intimacy only through carefully controlled theater",
  "subject": "my need for ritual",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state",
  "context": "intimacy patterns"
}
```

#### B. Emotional Engagement Patterns
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer is most alive and present during the anticipation and execution of Jon's submission; outside these encounters, he operates with detached competence but no genuine engagement",
  "subject": "my emotional presence",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state",
  "context": "when I feel most alive"
}
```

#### C. Psychological Mechanisms
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer feeds on narrative complexity—the layers of Jon at Makenzie's table still feeling Spencer's touch, the divided loyalty, the secret they share",
  "subject": "narrative possession",
  "subjectType": "concept",
  "context": "what truly satisfies me"
}
```

```json
{
  "text": "Spencer maintains precise psychological pressure—just enough threat, just enough promise—keeping Jon in exact awareness that validates Spencer's control",
  "subject": "psychological calibration",
  "subjectType": "skill",
  "context": "manipulation technique"
}
```

**Rationale**: Personality descriptions reveal psychological mechanisms that drive behavior. Categorizing as `psychological_state`, `concept`, or `skill` makes these patterns searchable and usable for AI behavior generation.

---

### 3. `core:strengths` Component

**Component Purpose**: Capabilities, competencies, effective patterns

**Extraction Strategy**: Convert each strength into a discrete skill or capability note

**Recommended Extractions**:

#### A. Patience & Sustained Campaigns
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer can maintain year-long psychological campaigns with consistent attention to detail through relentless patience",
  "subject": "sustained manipulation",
  "subjectType": "skill",
  "context": "demonstrated capability"
}
```

#### B. Psychological Reading
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer has learned to read Jon's internal states with real accuracy because violation requires attention in ways consensual relationships never demanded",
  "subject": "reading emotional states",
  "subjectType": "skill",
  "context": "developed through coercion"
}
```

#### C. Cognitive Reframing
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer can reframe his own actions internally to maintain self-concept, experiencing possession as intimacy and coercion as seduction without cognitive dissonance",
  "subject": "self-deception mechanism",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state",
  "context": "how I maintain functionality"
}
```

**Rationale**: Strengths are actionable capabilities. Tagging as `skill` makes them available for AI to model competent behavior. Some strengths are better categorized as `psychological_state` when they're internal mechanisms rather than external capabilities.

---

### 4. `core:weaknesses` Component

**Component Purpose**: Vulnerabilities, dependencies, failure modes

**Extraction Strategy**: Identify each distinct vulnerability or constraint

**Recommended Extractions**:

#### A. Dependency on Third Parties
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer needs Makenzie's ignorance and presence to create the power dynamic, making him constrained by his daughter's participation",
  "subject": "dependence on Makenzie",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state",
  "context": "vulnerability in my scheme"
}
```

#### B. Ritual Requirements
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer can't simply take what he wants; he needs Jon's resistance-breaking process, making him vulnerable to Jon manipulating that very need",
  "subject": "need for ceremony",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state",
  "context": "exploitable weakness"
}
```

#### C. Paradoxical Control Impossibility
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer requires Jon's awareness of being trapped to validate conquest, but Jon must retain enough selfhood to know he's being authored—creating impossible calibration that makes Spencer's control perpetually incomplete",
  "subject": "impossible control paradox",
  "subjectType": "concept",
  "context": "fundamental limitation"
}
```

**Rationale**: Weaknesses reveal exploitable vulnerabilities. Categorizing as `psychological_state` or `concept` helps AI identify potential leverage points or failure modes in behavior.

---

### 5. `core:likes` Component

**Component Purpose**: Preferences, sources of satisfaction, valued experiences

**Extraction Strategy**: Break down into specific preference categories

**Recommended Extractions**:

#### A. Dominance Validation
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer loves proving masculine superiority over other men and reinforcing age/power dynamics through ownership language like 'boy' and 'mine'",
  "subject": "dominance expression",
  "subjectType": "emotion",
  "context": "what brings satisfaction"
}
```

#### B. Physical Contact Preferences
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer craves the specific weight of Jon's body in initial embrace moments before resistance breaks—that brief tension where he feels Jon's conflicted presence most intensely",
  "subject": "physical intimacy with Jon",
  "subjectType": "emotion",
  "context": "preferred sensations"
}
```

#### C. Narrative Complexity
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer feeds on watching Jon interact normally with Makenzie after their encounters, enjoying the private knowledge of Jon's internal division and betrayal complexity",
  "subject": "narrative possession",
  "subjectType": "emotion",
  "context": "psychological satisfaction"
}
```

#### D. Anticipatory Rituals
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer experiences nervous energy resembling courtship during anticipatory hours before Jon arrives, while preparing himself and the space",
  "subject": "anticipation rituals",
  "subjectType": "emotion",
  "context": "pre-encounter feelings"
}
```

#### E. Sexual Preferences
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer gets off on Jon submitting, on making Jon admit desire to be fucked and penetrated by a better man, loves monologuing about masculine superiority during sexual submission",
  "subject": "sexual dominance",
  "subjectType": "emotion",
  "context": "arousal triggers"
}
```

**Rationale**: Likes reveal motivation triggers and reward systems. `emotion` subject type captures affective preferences, making them available for AI to model what drives pursuit behavior.

---

### 6. `core:dislikes` Component

**Component Purpose**: Aversions, irritants, negative triggers

**Extraction Strategy**: Categorize each distinct aversion

**Recommended Extractions**:

#### A. Authority Challenges
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer dislikes authority figures and anyone challenging his authority",
  "subject": "authority challenges",
  "subjectType": "emotion",
  "context": "behavioral triggers"
}
```

#### B. Easy Compliance Issues
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer dislikes when Jon complies too easily without resistance, because submission without reluctance feels hollow and fails to prove exceptionalism",
  "subject": "Jon's easy compliance",
  "subjectType": "emotion",
  "context": "undermines validation"
}
```

#### C. Loss of Control Indicators
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer dislikes Makenzie's wedding planning that assumes a future he hasn't controlled, reminding him of variables beyond his orchestration",
  "subject": "wedding planning",
  "subjectType": "emotion",
  "context": "uncontrolled variables"
}
```

#### D. Unwanted Genuine Feelings
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer dislikes catching himself genuinely concerned about Jon's emotional state in non-strategic ways, as it threatens his self-concept as possessor rather than needer",
  "subject": "genuine concern for Jon",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state",
  "context": "threatens self-image"
}
```

#### E. Others' Casual Intimacy
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer dislikes witnessing others' casual intimacy (couples touching, friends with easy affection) because it highlights his only connection requires elaborate coercion machinery",
  "subject": "normal intimacy displays",
  "subjectType": "observation",
  "context": "painful reminders"
}
```

**Rationale**: Dislikes reveal avoidance patterns and emotional vulnerabilities. Mix of `emotion`, `psychological_state`, and `observation` captures different aversion types.

---

### 7. `core:fears` Component

**Component Purpose**: Anxieties, dreaded outcomes, psychological vulnerabilities

**Extraction Strategy**: Each distinct fear becomes its own note

**Recommended Extractions**:

#### A. Meaninglessness of Conquest
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer fears Jon's submission indicates authentic desire rather than conquest, meaning he hasn't converted anything—just found alignment, rendering the dynamic meaningless as proof of exceptionalism",
  "subject": "Jon's authentic desire",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state",
  "context": "existential fear"
}
```

#### B. Unprocessable Attachment
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer fears recognizing his attachment to Jon and losing ability to experience it as dominance, leaving him psychologically stranded with genuine feeling he can't process except through intensified possession that could destroy the dynamic",
  "subject": "genuine attachment to Jon",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state",
  "context": "catastrophic vulnerability"
}
```

**Rationale**: Fears are deep psychological vulnerabilities. `psychological_state` captures their internal, affective nature, making them available for AI to model avoidance behavior and breaking points.

---

### 8. `core:goals` Component

**Component Purpose**: Objectives, desired outcomes, strategic aims

**Extraction Strategy**: Each goal becomes a `plan` or `quest` note

**Recommended Extractions**:

#### A. Extended Encounters
```json
{
  "text": "Engineer situations forcing Jon into longer villa stays, extending encounters beyond quick submissions into something approaching cohabitation without naming it",
  "subject": "extended time with Jon",
  "subjectType": "plan",
  "context": "ongoing objective"
}
```

#### B. Calibrated Control
```json
{
  "text": "Calibrate precise balance of financial promise and exposure threat keeping Jon compliant but aware—not broken enough to lose selfhood, not resistant enough to escape",
  "subject": "maintaining Jon's compliance",
  "subjectType": "plan",
  "context": "control strategy"
}
```

#### C. Voluntary Submission
```json
{
  "text": "Transform Jon's reluctant submission into autonomous hunger for encounters, creating voluntary psychological bondage where Jon needs Spencer's attention through his own desire",
  "subject": "Jon's voluntary submission",
  "subjectType": "quest",
  "context": "ultimate goal"
}
```

#### D. Marriage Lock-In
```json
{
  "text": "Lock Jon into marriage with Makenzie to ensure Jon remains forever under Spencer's grasp for continued sexual exploitation",
  "subject": "Jon and Makenzie's wedding",
  "subjectType": "plan",
  "context": "long-term strategy"
}
```

**Rationale**: Goals are forward-looking intentions. `plan` for tactical objectives, `quest` for transformational achievements. Makes strategic thinking available to AI for goal-directed behavior.

---

### 9. `core:secrets` Component

**Component Purpose**: Hidden information, concealed truths, private knowledge

**Extraction Strategy**: Each distinct secret with appropriate handling sensitivity

**Recommended Extractions**:

#### A. Blackmail Materials
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer has been recording/photographing encounters with Jon for blackmail leverage; Jon knows about some recordings, but Spencer keeps the ones including himself carefully hidden",
  "subject": "recordings of Jon",
  "subjectType": "item",
  "context": "blackmail insurance"
}
```

#### B. Developing Attachment
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer is developing attachment to Jon that he processes only as intensified possessiveness, resenting Makenzie's claims on Jon's time in ways that threaten to expose the dynamic",
  "subject": "attachment to Jon",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state",
  "context": "hidden emotional development"
}
```

#### C. Domestic Nesting Behaviors
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer has unconsciously rearranged the master bedroom around encounters with Jon—replaced bedding, adjusted lighting, changed bed sides—domestic modifications revealing nesting around this relationship",
  "subject": "bedroom modifications",
  "subjectType": "observation",
  "context": "unconscious domesticity"
}
```

**Rationale**: Secrets are critical for maintaining information asymmetry in narrative. Diverse subject types (`item`, `psychological_state`, `observation`) reflect the varied nature of hidden information.

---

### 10. `core:internal_tensions` Component

**Component Purpose**: Contradictions, paradoxes, self-defeating patterns

**Extraction Strategy**: Each tension as a distinct conceptual note

**Recommended Extractions**:

#### A. Marriage Paradox
```json
{
  "text": "The marriage Spencer orchestrates will create new claims on Jon's time and expectations that threaten Spencer's access, yet Spencer believes he's securing Jon's captivity forever",
  "subject": "wedding paradox",
  "subjectType": "concept",
  "context": "self-defeating strategy"
}
```

#### B. Awareness Calibration Impossibility
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer simultaneously needs Jon ignorant enough to stay ensnared but conscious enough to know he's being authored—an impossible calibration making Spencer's control perpetually incomplete",
  "subject": "awareness paradox",
  "subjectType": "concept",
  "context": "fundamental contradiction"
}
```

#### C. Victory vs. Satisfaction Conflict
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer's legal career taught him elegant victories are when opponents don't know they've lost, yet his deepest satisfaction with Jon comes from the young man's awareness of being trapped",
  "subject": "satisfaction paradox",
  "subjectType": "concept",
  "context": "conflicting needs"
}
```

**Rationale**: Internal tensions are conceptual contradictions that drive dramatic potential. `concept` subject type makes these logical paradoxes available for AI to model self-defeating behavior.

---

### 11. `core:motivations` Component

**Component Purpose**: Driving forces, fundamental needs, core psychological engines

**Extraction Strategy**: Break complex motivations into thematic drives

**Recommended Extractions**:

#### A. Narrative Possession Drive
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer is driven to possess not just Jon's body but the narrative complexity of Jon's divided self—the fiancé at Makenzie's table who still feels Spencer's hands",
  "subject": "psychological ownership",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state",
  "context": "core motivation"
}
```

#### B. Voluntary Devotion Desire
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer wants to discover if Jon's submission can evolve from coerced compliance to voluntary devotion, not from empathy but because conquest of the unwilling feels incomplete",
  "subject": "Jon's voluntary need",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state",
  "context": "completion drive"
}
```

#### C. Ritual Satisfaction
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer is motivated by the ritual of anticipated violation—the waiting, the preparation, the psychological foreplay—because the seduction process itself has become his primary source of feeling alive",
  "subject": "seduction rituals",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state",
  "context": "what makes me feel alive"
}
```

#### D. Exceptionalism Proof
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer needs proof of exceptionalism through Jon's heterosexuality specifically—converting fundamental orientation through dominance—because professional success proved insufficient validation",
  "subject": "need for exceptionalism",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state",
  "context": "identity validation"
}
```

**Rationale**: Motivations are deep psychological drivers. All categorized as `psychological_state` because they represent internal needs that generate behavior patterns.

---

### 12. `core:dilemmas` Component

**Component Purpose**: Core philosophical/psychological questions, unresolvable tensions

**Extraction Strategy**: Transform into theory or concept notes

**Recommended Extractions**:

```json
{
  "text": "Can someone who needs their victim's authentic resistance to validate dominance ever accept that continued submission might indicate authentic desire? What happens when the need for another's realness conflicts with the need for their reality to conform to your narrative?",
  "subject": "resistance vs. desire paradox",
  "subjectType": "theory",
  "context": "existential question"
}
```

**Alternative Extraction**:
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer faces an unresolvable dilemma: if Jon's resistance is necessary to validate the conquest, but Jon develops authentic desire, does that invalidate the entire dynamic's meaning?",
  "subject": "conquest validation paradox",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state",
  "context": "core existential tension"
}
```

**Rationale**: Dilemmas can be framed as either abstract theories about human nature or specific psychological states. Choose based on whether the AI needs philosophical frameworks (`theory`) or personal stakes (`psychological_state`).

---

### 13. `core:speech_patterns` Component

**Component Purpose**: Linguistic habits, verbal tendencies, communication style

**Extraction Strategy**: Each distinct pattern as an observation or skill note

**Recommended Extractions** (if populated):

```json
{
  "text": "Spencer uses ownership language like 'boy' and 'mine' when addressing Jon to reinforce power dynamics",
  "subject": "verbal dominance",
  "subjectType": "observation",
  "context": "speech pattern"
}
```

```json
{
  "text": "Spencer monologues about his masculine superiority during sexual encounters with Jon",
  "subject": "sexual monologuing",
  "subjectType": "observation",
  "context": "verbal behavior during intimacy"
}
```

**Rationale**: Speech patterns are observable behaviors. `observation` subject type captures what can be noticed about communication style, making it available for AI dialogue generation.

---

## Cross-Component Synthesis Recommendations

### Relationship Web Building

Many components reference Jon Itxasondo. Create synthesized relationship notes:

```json
{
  "text": "Jon Itxasondo is my daughter Makenzie's 19-year-old fiancé. I've been coercing him into a sexual relationship for the past year using financial leverage and blackmail. This has become my most sustained intimate relationship, though it requires elaborate manipulation to exist. I'm developing genuine attachment but can only process it as possessive control.",
  "subject": "Jon Itxasondo",
  "subjectType": "relationship",
  "context": "complete relationship status"
}
```

### Thematic Clustering

Create summary notes for recurring themes:

```json
{
  "text": "My entire dynamic with Jon depends on an impossible calibration: he must be aware enough to know he's being dominated (for my validation) but not aware enough to escape. I need his resistance to prove my power, but I also want his voluntary submission to prove my exceptionalism. These contradictory needs make my control perpetually incomplete.",
  "subject": "control paradox",
  "subjectType": "concept",
  "context": "core psychological pattern"
}
```

### Knowledge State Tracking

For information about other characters' awareness:

```json
{
  "text": "Makenzie is unaware of my sexual relationship with Jon. Her ignorance is essential to the power dynamic I need.",
  "subject": "Makenzie's knowledge",
  "subjectType": "knowledge_state",
  "context": "what my daughter doesn't know"
}
```

## Subject Type Usage Guidelines

### High-Priority Subject Types for Character Components

Based on Spencer Hawthorne's analysis:

| Subject Type | Primary Use Cases | Extraction Frequency |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| `psychological_state` | Internal drives, mental patterns, emotional conditions, fears, attachments | **Very High** |
| `character` | References to other entities, character descriptions | **High** |
| `relationship` | Social bonds, connections, interaction dynamics | **High** |
| `emotion` | Likes, dislikes, affective preferences, satisfaction sources | **High** |
| `concept` | Abstract patterns, paradoxes, philosophical frameworks | **Medium** |
| `plan` | Tactical objectives, strategies, short-term goals | **Medium** |
| `quest` | Transformational goals, long-term ambitions | **Medium** |
| `theory` | Beliefs about how things work, worldviews | **Medium** |
| `observation` | Physical descriptions, speech patterns, noticed behaviors | **Medium** |
| `knowledge_state` | What is known/unknown by self or others | **Low-Medium** |
| `location` | Living spaces, significant places | **Low** |
| `event` | Past incidents, turning points | **Low** |
| `item` | Possessions, recordings, physical objects | **Low** |
| `skill` | Competencies, capabilities, developed abilities | **Low** |

### Rarely Used Subject Types for Character Components

- `creature` - Unlikely unless character has specific animal relationships
- `organization` - Only if character has institutional affiliations
- `timeline` - Better as context field; use sparingly for complex chronologies
- `other` - Avoid; indicates need for better categorization

---

## Extraction Best Practices

### 1. Granularity Principles

**Too Coarse** (Avoid):
```json
{
  "text": "[Entire 500-word personality component text]",
  "subject": "my personality",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state"
}
```

**Too Fine** (Avoid):
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer is 55",
  "subject": "my age",
  "subjectType": "observation"
}
```

**Optimal Granularity**:
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer is a 55-year-old American from Chicago now living in Donostia, Spain. He's a CEO of an international law firm",
  "subject": "myself",
  "subjectType": "character",
  "context": "basic identity"
}
```

**Guidelines**:
- Each note should contain 1-3 related sentences (20-100 words)
- Group thematically related information
- Split when subject type would need to change
- Prioritize searchability over comprehensiveness

### 2. Context Field Usage

The `context` field should indicate:
- Source component (e.g., "from personality", "from profile")
- Relationship to subject (e.g., "my daughter", "my secret")
- Thematic category (e.g., "sexual preferences", "vulnerability")
- Temporal markers (e.g., "current situation", "past event")

**Examples**:
```json
"context": "from profile - family background"
"context": "from strengths - manipulation capability"
"context": "from secrets - hidden emotional state"
"context": "current ongoing scheme"
```

### 3. Subject Field Conventions

**For Self-Reference**:
- Use "myself" for identity/demographics
- Use "my [aspect]" for personal attributes (e.g., "my fear of attachment", "my villa", "my career")

**For Other Characters**:
- Use full names for primary characters (e.g., "Jon Itxasondo", "Makenzie Hawthorne")
- Use descriptive phrases for abstract concepts (e.g., "control paradox", "narrative possession")

**For Concepts**:
- Use noun phrases that capture the essence (e.g., "awareness paradox", "ritual seduction process")

### 4. Avoiding Redundancy

**Problem**: Multiple components may reference the same information

**Solution**: Create one canonical note, reference from others via subject

**Example**:
Instead of repeating "Jon is my daughter's fiancé" in multiple notes, create one character note for Jon, then reference:

```json
{
  "text": "My goal is to transform Jon's submission into voluntary desire",
  "subject": "Jon Itxasondo",
  "subjectType": "quest",
  "context": "from goals"
}
```

The AI can then link to the existing Jon character note for biographical details.

## Implementation Strategies

### Automated Extraction Approach

#### 1. Component-to-Note Templates

Create extraction templates for each component type:

```javascript
const extractionTemplates = {
  'core:profile': [
    { pattern: /demographics|age|origin/, subjectType: 'character', subject: 'myself' },
    { pattern: /family|married|daughter|son/, subjectType: 'relationship', subject: 'family' },
    { pattern: /career|job|profession/, subjectType: 'timeline', subject: 'my career' },
    { pattern: /lives? in|residence|home/, subjectType: 'location', subject: 'home' }
  ],
  'core:personality': [
    { pattern: /needs?|requires?|must have/, subjectType: 'psychological_state', context: 'core need' },
    { pattern: /pattern|tendency|typically/, subjectType: 'psychological_state', context: 'behavior pattern' }
  ],
  'core:goals': [
    { pattern: /.*/, subjectType: 'plan', context: 'objective' }  // Most goals are plans
  ],
  'core:fears': [
    { pattern: /.*/, subjectType: 'psychological_state', context: 'fear' }
  ]
  // ... additional templates
};
```

#### 2. Semantic Chunking

Use NLP to identify:
- Sentence boundaries
- Topic shifts
- Entity mentions
- Temporal markers

Then group sentences into coherent notes of 1-3 sentences.

#### 3. Subject Type Classification

Train classifier on patterns:
- **Psychological state**: "feels", "needs", "experiences", "driven by"
- **Character**: Proper nouns, "he/she", age mentions, professions
- **Relationship**: "with", "to", familial terms, social verbs
- **Emotion**: "likes", "dislikes", "loves", "hates", affective language
- **Concept**: Abstract nouns, "-ness" words, philosophical language
- **Plan**: "wants to", "intends to", "goal is to"

### AI-Assisted Extraction Prompts

#### Prompt Template 1: Component Analysis
```
Analyze this character component and extract 3-7 discrete notes following this format:

Component Type: {componentType}
Component Text: {componentText}

For each note:
1. Identify a distinct piece of information (1-3 sentences)
2. Determine the most appropriate subject type from: {subjectTypeList}
3. Create a concise subject label
4. Provide context indicating source and relationship

Output as JSON array of notes.
```

#### Prompt Template 2: Subject Type Selection
```
Given this extracted text from a character component:

"{extractedText}"

Which subject type best categorizes this information?

- character: References to entities, biographical facts

{arrayOfNotes}

Should these be:
A) Kept separate with their current subject types
B) Merged into a single comprehensive note
C) Split differently with new subject categorizations

Provide reasoning and recommended structure.
```

### Quality Control Checklist

Before finalizing extractions, verify:

- [ ] **No duplicate information** across notes
- [ ] **Subject types align** with information category
- [ ] **Context fields provide** source and relationship
- [ ] **Subject labels are** concise and searchable
- [ ] **Granularity is optimal** (not too broad, not too fine)
- [ ] **Cross-references are clear** (related notes reference same subjects)
- [ ] **Sensitive content is appropriately categorized** (not hidden in generic types)
- [ ] **Temporal information is preserved** where relevant
- [ ] **Relationships maintain directionality** (who relates to whom)

## Advanced Considerations

### Dynamic Note Generation During Play

Some character information may need to be generated dynamically:

#### A. Evolving Psychological States
```json
{
  "text": "Today Spencer feels increasingly resentful of Makenzie's time with Jon, more than usual",
  "subject": "current emotional state",
  "subjectType": "psychological_state",
  "context": "today's feelings",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T14:30:00Z"
}
```

#### B. New Observations
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer noticed Jon seemed more withdrawn today, avoiding eye contact more than usual",
  "subject": "Jon's behavior today",
  "subjectType": "observation",
  "context": "recent interaction",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T15:00:00Z"
}
```

#### C. Revised Theories
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer is beginning to suspect Jon might actually enjoy their encounters, which would undermine his entire narrative of conquest",
  "subject": "Jon's authentic desire",
  "subjectType": "theory",
  "context": "emerging suspicion",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T16:00:00Z"
}
```

### Handling Mature/Sensitive Content

Spencer Hawthorne's character contains explicit sexual content and manipulation themes. Extraction principles:

1. **Don't sanitize**: Maintain narrative integrity
2. **Use precise subject types**: Sexual preferences → `emotion`, coercion mechanics → `psychological_state`
3. **Clear context markers**: "sexual preferences", "coercion strategy", "exploitation pattern"
4. **Preserve complexity**: Don't reduce to simple good/evil; capture psychological nuance

### AI Retrieval Optimization

Structure notes to optimize AI search/retrieval:

**Search-Friendly Subject Labels**:
- ✅ "Jon Itxasondo" (name-based search)
- ✅ "control paradox" (thematic search)
- ❌ "it" (pronoun - non-searchable)
- ❌ "the thing I do" (vague reference)

**Context Field Searchability**:
- Include keywords AI might query on
- Use consistent terminology across similar notes
- Add thematic tags when helpful

**Example**:
```json
{
  "text": "...",
  "subject": "Jon Itxasondo",
  "subjectType": "relationship",
  "context": "sexual relationship, coercion, manipulation, secret affair, psychological control"
}
```

## Example: Complete Extraction for One Component

### Input: `core:strengths` Component
```json
{
  "text": "Spencer can maintain year-long psychological campaigns with consistent attention to detail, making him dangerous not through brilliance but through relentless patience. He's learned to read Jon's internal states with real accuracy not because he's a master manipulator but because violation requires him to pay attention in ways consensual relationships never demanded of him. Spencer can reframe his own actions internally to maintain self-concept, allowing him to experience possession as intimacy and coercion as seduction without cognitive dissonance breaking his functionality."
}
```

### Output: Extracted Notes Array
```json
{
  "notes": [
    {
      "text": "Spencer can maintain year-long psychological campaigns with consistent attention to detail through relentless patience rather than brilliance",
      "subject": "sustained manipulation",
      "subjectType": "skill",
      "context": "from strengths - long-term capability"
    },
    {
      "text": "Spencer has learned to read Jon's internal states with real accuracy because violation requires attention in ways consensual relationships never demanded",
      "subject": "reading Jon's emotional states",
      "subjectType": "skill",
      "context": "from strengths - developed through exploitation"
    },
    {
      "text": "Spencer can reframe his own actions internally to maintain self-concept, experiencing possession as intimacy and coercion as seduction without cognitive dissonance",
      "subject": "self-deception mechanism",
      "subjectType": "psychological_state",
      "context": "from strengths - psychological defense"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Extraction Rationale**:
- **Three distinct capabilities** identified and separated
- **First two** are external skills → `skill` subject type
- **Third** is internal psychological mechanism → `psychological_state`
- **Subjects** are action-focused and searchable
- **Context fields** indicate source component and thematic category
- **Granularity** is optimal: each note contains complete thought with supporting detail

## Summary & Key Takeaways

### Core Principles
1. **Granularity Matters**: 1-3 sentence notes optimize AI accessibility vs. comprehensiveness
2. **Subject Types Are Semantic Tags**: Use them to classify information type, not just categorize
3. **Context Fields Add Depth**: Source, relationship, and thematic markers enhance retrieval
4. **Avoid Redundancy**: One canonical note per piece of information; reference across related notes
5. **Preserve Complexity**: Especially for mature content, maintain psychological nuance

### Subject Type Distribution Guidance

For typical complex character like Spencer Hawthorne:

- **40-50% psychological_state**: Core drives, internal patterns, mental conditions
- **15-20% character/relationship**: Biographical facts and social connections
- **10-15% emotion**: Affective preferences (likes/dislikes)
- **10-15% concept**: Abstract patterns, paradoxes, theories
- **10-15% plan/quest**: Goals and objectives
- **5-10% observation/skill**: Behaviors and capabilities
- **5% other types**: Location, item, event, knowledge_state as needed

### Success Metrics

Extraction quality can be measured by:
- **Retrieval accuracy**: AI finds relevant notes for queries
- **Information coverage**: No significant character details missing
- **Categorization consistency**: Similar info uses similar subject types
- **Cross-reference integrity**: Related notes properly linked via subjects
- **Granularity balance**: Notes are neither too broad nor too fragmented
