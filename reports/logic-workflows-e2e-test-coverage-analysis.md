## 3. Prioritized E2E Test Recommendations

### Priority 1: CRITICAL - Core System Integrity
These workflows are fundamental to system operation and data integrity.

#### 1.1 Operation Registry and Handler Resolution
**File**: `tests/e2e/logic/operationRegistryWorkflow.e2e.test.js`
**Coverage Goals**:
- Dynamic handler registration/overriding
- Handler lookup with various operation types
- Error handling for missing handlers

**Status**: Test suite removed due to outdated API assumptions requiring complete rewrite
**Note**: Has indirect coverage through JSON Logic tests

#### 1.3 Flow Control Execution  
**Status**: Test suite removed due to ill-designed implementation requiring complete rewrite
**Note**: Basic flow control is tested through other integration tests

### Priority 2: HIGH - Data Modification and State Management
These workflows directly modify game state and require transactional integrity.

#### 2.1 Component Operations Suite
**File**: `tests/e2e/logic/componentOperationsWorkflow.e2e.test.js`

**Coverage Goals**:
- Standard event dispatch
- Perceptible events with location filtering
- Speech event handling
- Event payload validation

#### 3.2 Perception and Logging
**File**: `tests/e2e/logic/perceptionSystemWorkflow.e2e.test.js`
**Coverage Goals**:
- Perception log entry creation
- Event visibility rules
- Location-based filtering

### Priority 4: NICE-TO-HAVE - Specialized Operations
These are important but less frequently used workflows.

#### 4.1 Query Operations
**File**: `tests/e2e/logic/queryOperationsWorkflow.e2e.test.js`
**Coverage Goals**:
- Entity queries with filters
- Component queries
- Complex query combinations

#### 4.2 Utility Operations
**File**: `tests/e2e/logic/utilityOperationsWorkflow.e2e.test.js`
**Coverage Goals**:
- Math operations
- Timestamp generation

- Variable setting

## 4. Implementation Recommendations

### 4.1 Test Structure Guidelines

Each e2e test file should follow this structure:
```javascript
describe('Workflow Name E2E', () => {
  // Setup test environment
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Initialize complete system
    // Load test mods/data
  });

  describe('Happy Path Scenarios', () => {
    // Test normal operation flows
  });

  describe('Error Handling', () => {
    // Test error conditions and recovery
  });

  describe('Edge Cases', () => {
    // Test boundary conditions
  });

  describe('Performance Characteristics', () => {
    // Test under load/stress
  });
});
```

**Note on Existing Infrastructure**: 
- Leverage existing test beds in `tests/e2e/entities/common/sharedEntityTestBed.js` where applicable
- The contextAssembler has helper utilities already exposed in JSON Logic tests
- ComponentMutationWorkflow.e2e.test.js provides entity-level patterns that can be extended for handler testing

### 4.2 Test Data Management

- Create dedicated test mods in `data/mods/test/`
- Use fixtures for complex entity setups
- Implement test builders for common scenarios

### 4.3 Coverage Metrics Goals

**Target Coverage by Priority**:
- Priority 1: 90% branch coverage
- Priority 2: 80% branch coverage
- Priority 3: 70% branch coverage
- Priority 4: 60% branch coverage

### 4.4 Execution Timeline

**Phase 1 (Week 1-2)**: Implement all Priority 1 tests
**Phase 2 (Week 3-4)**: Implement Priority 2 tests
**Phase 3 (Week 5)**: Implement Priority 3 tests
**Phase 4 (Week 6)**: Implement Priority 4 tests

## 5. Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas Requiring Immediate Attention:

1. **Operation Registry** - Central to all operations, no current e2e coverage
2. **Context Assembly** - Critical for rule evaluation, has indirect coverage but needs direct workflow testing
3. **Flow Control** - Complex branching logic, untested edge cases
4. **Component Operation Handlers** - Entity-level tests exist but handler pipeline untested
5. **Atomic Operations** - Concurrency issues could corrupt game state

### Potential Issues from Lack of Coverage:

- **Data Corruption**: Component operations without proper validation
- **Infinite Loops**: Flow control without cycle detection
- **Memory Leaks**: Context not properly cleaned up
- **Race Conditions**: Concurrent modifications without atomicity

## 6. Conclusion

The `src/logic/` layer implements complex workflows that are partially covered by existing e2e tests. While action execution and JSON Logic evaluation have good coverage, critical infrastructure components require attention:

- **Operation Registry**: Completely uncovered, highest risk
- **Flow Control Handlers**: No e2e tests at all
- **Context Assembly**: Has indirect coverage through JSON Logic tests but needs direct workflow testing
- **Component Operations**: Entity-level tests exist but operation handlers through the full pipeline remain untested

Implementing the prioritized test recommendations will significantly improve system reliability. The report correctly identified most gaps, with minor corrections needed around contextAssembler's indirect coverage and the distinction between entity-level vs handler-level testing for component operations.
