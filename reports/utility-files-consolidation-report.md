# Utility Files Consolidation Report

**Date**: 2025-07-10  
**Purpose**: Consolidate utility and helper files into the `src/utils/` directory

## Executive Summary

This report documents the consolidation of utility and helper files that were scattered throughout the codebase into the centralized `src/utils/` directory. This refactoring improves code organization and maintainability by following the established project convention where all shared utilities are kept in a single location.

## Files Moved

### 1. Entity Component Utils

- **From**: `src/scopeDsl/core/entityComponentUtils.js`
- **To**: `src/utils/entityComponentUtils.js`
- **Description**: Utility for building component objects for entities

### 2. Portrait Utils

- **From**: `src/entities/utils/portraitUtils.js`
- **To**: `src/utils/portraitUtils.js`
- **Description**: Helper utilities for building entity portrait data

### 3. Registry Store Utils

- **From**: `src/loaders/helpers/registryStoreUtils.js`
- **To**: `src/utils/registryStoreUtils.js`
- **Description**: Utility for storing items in the registry with standardized metadata

### 4. Turn State Validation Utils

- **From**: `src/turns/states/helpers/validationUtils.js`
- **To**: `src/utils/turnStateValidationUtils.js`
- **Description**: Validation utilities for turn state actors
- **Note**: Renamed to avoid confusion with existing validation utilities

## Import Updates

### Source Files Updated

1. **entityComponentUtils.js** - 3 files updated:
   - `src/scopeDsl/core/entityHelpers.js`
   - `src/scopeDsl/core/entityBuilder.js`
   - `tests/unit/scopeDsl/core/entityBuilder.test.js`

2. **portraitUtils.js** - 2 files updated:
   - `src/entities/entityDisplayDataProvider.js`
   - `src/entities/services/locationDisplayService.js`

3. **registryStoreUtils.js** - 1 file updated:
   - `src/loaders/baseManifestItemLoader.js`

4. **turnStateValidationUtils.js** - 4 files updated:
   - `src/turns/states/abstractTurnState.js`
   - `src/turns/states/processingCommandState.js`
   - `src/turns/states/turnIdleState.js`
   - `src/turns/states/awaitingActorDecisionState.js`

### Test Files Moved

The following test files were moved to maintain the directory structure convention:

1. `tests/unit/entities/utils/portraitUtils.test.js` → `tests/unit/utils/portraitUtils.test.js`
2. `tests/unit/loaders/helpers/registryStoreUtils.test.js` → `tests/unit/utils/registryStoreUtils.test.js`
3. `tests/unit/loaders/helpers/registryStoreUtils.scope-id-mapping.test.js` → `tests/unit/utils/registryStoreUtils.scope-id-mapping.test.js`
4. `tests/unit/turns/states/helpers/validationUtils.test.js` → `tests/unit/utils/turnStateValidationUtils.test.js`
5. `tests/unit/turns/states/helpers/validationUtils.additionalBranches.test.js` → `tests/unit/utils/turnStateValidationUtils.additionalBranches.test.js`

## Internal Import Path Updates

Each moved file had its internal import paths updated to reflect the new location:

- Relative imports to other utils (e.g., `../../utils/` → `./`)
- Imports from parent directories adjusted (e.g., `../../../` → `../`)
- JSDoc type imports updated accordingly

## Validation Results

### Lint Check

- **Command**: `npm run lint`
- **Result**: ✅ Passed (existing warnings unrelated to refactoring)

### Test Suite

- **Command**: Targeted tests for moved files
- **Result**: ✅ All 57 tests passed
- **Files tested**:
  - portraitUtils.test.js
  - registryStoreUtils.test.js
  - turnStateValidationUtils.test.js
  - entityBuilder.test.js

### Type Check

- **Command**: `npm run typecheck`
- **Result**: ✅ No new errors introduced (existing TypeScript issues unrelated to refactoring)

## Benefits

1. **Improved Organization**: All utility files are now in a single, predictable location
2. **Better Discoverability**: Developers can easily find shared utilities
3. **Consistency**: Follows the established project pattern
4. **Maintainability**: Reduces directory nesting and simplifies the project structure

## Files Not Moved

The following utility/helper files remain outside of `src/utils/` as they are test-specific:

- All files in `tests/common/` - These are test utilities and should remain with the test infrastructure
- `llm-proxy-server/` utilities - This is a separate subproject and was excluded per instructions

## Recommendations

1. Update the project documentation to reflect this organizational standard
2. Consider creating a linting rule to prevent future utility files from being created outside `src/utils/`
3. Review remaining helper files in the codebase for potential consolidation

## Conclusion

The consolidation was completed successfully with all tests passing and no functional changes to the codebase. This refactoring improves the project's organization and makes it easier for developers to locate and use shared utilities.
