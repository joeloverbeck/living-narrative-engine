# ScopeDSL E2E Test Coverage Analysis Report

**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Author:** Architecture Analysis Team  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of scopeDsl workflows, current e2e test coverage, and prioritized recommendations for achieving full coverage

---

## Executive Summary

The scopeDsl system is a critical component of the Living Narrative Engine, providing a declarative Domain Specific Language (DSL) for defining action scopes. This report analyzes the system's distinct workflows, evaluates current end-to-end test coverage, and provides prioritized recommendations for achieving comprehensive test coverage.

### Key Findings
- **8 distinct workflows** identified in the scopeDsl production code
- **4 e2e test files** currently provide partial coverage (located in `/tests/e2e/scopeDsl/`)
- **Additional performance tests** exist in `/tests/performance/scopeDsl/` including `PerformanceScalability.e2e.test.js`
- **Critical gaps** exist in specialized resolver testing (clothing, union operators)
- **High-priority needs** include complex filter expressions and multi-mod interactions
- **Estimated effort**: 15-20 new test files needed for full coverage

### Coverage Status
- ✅ **Well Covered (70-90%)**: Basic resolution, error recovery, performance
- ⚠️ **Partially Covered (30-70%)**: Action integration, scope loading
- ❌ **Poorly Covered (<30%)**: Specialized resolvers, complex expressions, edge cases

## Section 1: ScopeDSL System Architecture

The scopeDsl system transforms declarative scope expressions into sets of entity IDs through a sophisticated pipeline:

```
.scope file → Parser → AST → Registry → Engine → Resolvers → Entity IDs
```

### Core Components
1. **Parser** (`scopeDsl/parser/parser.js`, `scopeDsl/parser/tokenizer.js`, `scopeDsl/scopeDefinitionParser.js`): Tokenizes and parses DSL expressions, supports both `+` and `|` union operators (identical behavior)
2. **Registry** (`scopeDsl/scopeRegistry.js`): Manages loaded scope definitions with ASTs
3. **Loader** (`loaders/scopeLoader.js`): Loads `.scope` files from mod directories
4. **Engine** (`scopeDsl/engine.js`): Orchestrates AST resolution with safety checks (max depth: 6)
5. **Resolvers** (`scopeDsl/nodes/`): Specialized handlers for different node types
6. **Core Utilities** (`scopeDsl/core/`): Validation, context management, error handling

## Conclusion

The scopeDsl system is well-architected but requires comprehensive e2e testing to ensure reliability and maintainability. This report identifies 8 distinct workflows, analyzes current coverage gaps, and provides a prioritized roadmap for achieving full test coverage.

The highest priority is testing union operators and clothing resolution workflows, as these are critical features with minimal current coverage. Following the proposed implementation roadmap will systematically address all identified gaps and bring the system to 95% e2e test coverage within 7 weeks.

### Key Recommendations
1. **Immediate Action**: Begin with Priority 1 tests for union operators and clothing
2. **Resource Allocation**: Dedicate 2 developers for 7 weeks
3. **Continuous Integration**: Add new tests to CI pipeline immediately
4. **Documentation**: Update test documentation as tests are added
5. **Review Process**: Conduct code reviews for all new tests

By following these recommendations, the Living Narrative Engine will have a robust, well-tested scopeDsl system that can confidently handle the complex requirements of narrative-driven gaming experiences.
