## Executive Summary

The scopeDsl system is a critical component of the Living Narrative Engine, providing a declarative Domain Specific Language (DSL) for defining action scopes. This report analyzes the system's distinct workflows, evaluates current end-to-end test coverage, and provides prioritized recommendations for achieving comprehensive test coverage.

### Key Findings

- **8 distinct workflows** identified in the scopeDsl production code
- **7 e2e test files** currently provide strong coverage (located in `/tests/e2e/scopeDsl/`)
- **Additional performance tests** provide E2E coverage in `/tests/performance/scopeDsl/`
- **All Priority 1 gaps addressed** - union operators, clothing resolution, and complex filters now tested
- **Remaining priorities** focus on multi-mod interactions and safety boundaries
- **Estimated effort**: 5-7 new test files needed for comprehensive coverage (reduced from 15-20)

### Coverage Status (Updated)

- ✅ **Well Covered (75-90%)**: Basic resolution, union operations, clothing resolution, complex filters, error recovery, performance
- ⚠️ **Partially Covered (40-70%)**: Multi-mod interactions, depth/cycle boundaries, concurrent access
- ❌ **Gaps Remaining (<40%)**: Cross-mod dependencies, dynamic updates, developer experience

## Section 1: ScopeDSL System Architecture

The scopeDsl system transforms declarative scope expressions into sets of entity IDs through a sophisticated pipeline:

```
.scope file → Parser → AST → Registry → Engine → Resolvers → Entity IDs
```

### Core Components

1. **Parser** (`scopeDsl/parser/parser.js`, `scopeDsl/parser/tokenizer.js`, `scopeDsl/scopeDefinitionParser.js`): Tokenizes and parses DSL expressions, supports both `+` and `|` union operators (identical behavior)
2. **Registry** (`scopeDsl/scopeRegistry.js`): Manages loaded scope definitions with ASTs
3. **Loader** (`loaders/scopeLoader.js`): Loads `.scope` files from mod directories
4. **Engine** (`scopeDsl/engine.js`): Orchestrates AST resolution with safety checks (max depth: 6)
5. **Resolvers** (`scopeDsl/nodes/`): Specialized handlers for different node types
6. **Core Utilities** (`scopeDsl/core/`): Validation, context management, error handling
