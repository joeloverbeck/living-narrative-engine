# ScopeDSL E2E Test Coverage Analysis Report

**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Author:** Architecture Analysis Team  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-26 - Post Priority 1 Implementation
**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of scopeDsl workflows, current e2e test coverage, and prioritized recommendations for achieving full coverage

---

## Executive Summary

The scopeDsl system is a critical component of the Living Narrative Engine, providing a declarative Domain Specific Language (DSL) for defining action scopes. This report analyzes the system's distinct workflows, evaluates current end-to-end test coverage, and provides prioritized recommendations for achieving comprehensive test coverage.

### Key Findings

- **8 distinct workflows** identified in the scopeDsl production code
- **9 e2e test files** currently provide strong coverage (located in `/tests/e2e/scopeDsl/`)
- **7 performance tests** provide additional E2E coverage in `/tests/performance/scopeDsl/`
- **All Priority 1 gaps addressed** - union operators, clothing resolution, complex filters, depth/cycle boundaries, and multi-mod interactions now tested
- **System architecture updated** - engine uses depth limit of 12, parser uses 6 for different validation phases
- **Estimated effort**: 2-3 additional test files needed for comprehensive coverage (significantly reduced from original 15-20)

### Coverage Status (Updated)

- ✅ **Well Covered (85-95%)**: Basic resolution, union operations, clothing resolution, complex filters, error recovery, performance, depth/cycle boundaries, multi-mod interactions
- ⚠️ **Partially Covered (50-75%)**: Concurrent access patterns, dynamic state updates
- ❌ **Gaps Remaining (<40%)**: Developer experience tooling, advanced context manipulation edge cases

## Section 1: ScopeDSL System Architecture

The scopeDsl system transforms declarative scope expressions into sets of entity IDs through a sophisticated pipeline:

```
.scope file → Parser → AST → Registry → Engine → Resolvers → Entity IDs
```

### Core Components

1. **Parser** (`scopeDsl/parser/parser.js`, `scopeDsl/parser/tokenizer.js`, `scopeDsl/scopeDefinitionParser.js`): Tokenizes and parses DSL expressions, supports both `+` and `|` union operators (identical behavior). Parser uses depth limit of 6 levels for parsing validation.
2. **Registry** (`scopeDsl/scopeRegistry.js`): Manages loaded scope definitions with ASTs
3. **Loader** (`loaders/scopeLoader.js`): Loads `.scope` files from mod directories
4. **Engine** (`scopeDsl/engine.js`): Orchestrates AST resolution with safety checks (max depth: 12 for runtime resolution)
5. **Resolvers** (`scopeDsl/nodes/`): Specialized handlers for different node types including `scopeReferenceResolver.js` for cross-scope references
6. **Core Utilities** (`scopeDsl/core/`): Validation, context management, error handling
