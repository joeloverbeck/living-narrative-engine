## 1. Entity Architecture Overview

### 1.1 System Architecture

The entity system follows a sophisticated layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
Entity Manager (Facade)
├── Specialized Managers
│   ├── EntityCreationManager    → Entity lifecycle initiation
│   ├── EntityMutationManager    → Component modifications  
│   └── EntityQueryManager       → Entity retrieval & queries
├── Core Services
│   ├── EntityLifecycleManager   → Full lifecycle operations
│   ├── ComponentMutationService → Component state changes
│   └── EntityRepositoryAdapter  → Data persistence
├── Operations Layer
│   ├── BatchOperationManager    → Bulk operations
│   └── BatchSpatialIndexManager → Spatial bulk updates
└── Supporting Systems
    ├── SpatialIndexManager      → Location-based indexing
    ├── MonitoringCoordinator    → Performance & health
