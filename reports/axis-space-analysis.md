Axis Space Analysis
Prototypes Analyzed:
108
Recommendations:
70
Confidence:
high
(?)
Confidence reflects how many independent detection methods agree: Low (0-1 methods), Medium (2 methods), High (3-4 methods).

New Axis Recommended?
MAYBE
Residual variance (28.4%) exceeds 15% threshold, indicating unexplained dimensions. However, no strong secondary signals (coverage gaps, hub prototypes) were detected. Consider reviewing poorly fitting prototypes.

How is this determined?
YES: (High residual AND coverage gaps) OR (Hub prototypes AND multi-axis conflicts)
MAYBE: High residual alone, OR any other single signal
NO: Residual ≤15% AND no detection signals
Important: PCA uses OR logic for triggering. High residual variance (>15%) alone is sufficient for MAYBE verdict, regardless of "Additional Components" count.

Detection Logic: PCA signal triggers when residual variance >15% OR additional components >0. Either condition alone is sufficient for triggering INVESTIGATE recommendations.

Dimensionality Analysis (PCA)
Principal Component Analysis reveals whether the current axis set captures prototype variance. High residual variance suggests missing dimensions.
