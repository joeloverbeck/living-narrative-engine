- Use performance-isolated test runners to avoid timing interference

#### Test Data Patterns

- Create realistic action sequences that exercise different tracing paths
- Use varied actor configurations to test different component combinations
- Include edge cases like missing components, invalid targets, etc.
- Test both successful and failure scenarios for comprehensive coverage

#### Assertion Strategies

- Validate trace data structure and content accuracy
- Assert on performance timing within acceptable tolerances
- Check file system state for proper output generation
- Verify queue states and processing order correctness
- Test memory usage stays within expected bounds

#### Test Isolation

- Each test should be fully independent and idempotent
- Clean up all trace files, queues, and system state between tests
- Use unique identifiers to prevent cross-test interference
- Reset performance monitoring state between test runs
