- Opportunity for improved service boundaries and reduced inter-module coupling

## Current Architecture Analysis

### 1. E2E Test Architecture

#### Test Module Pattern Implementation

The E2E tests reveal a sophisticated **Test Module Pattern** that dramatically simplifies test setup:

```javascript
// BEFORE: 150+ lines manual setup → 20 lines facade setup
// AFTER: 20 lines facade setup → 5 lines Test Module Pattern

testEnv = await TestModuleBuilder.forTurnExecution()
  .withMockLLM({ strategy: 'tool-calling' })
  .withTestActors([{ id: 'ai-actor', name: 'Elara the Bard' }])
  .withWorld({ name: 'Test World', createConnections: true })
  .build();
```

**Benefits Identified:**
- **Fluent API Design**: Chainable configuration methods improve readability
- **Encapsulated Complexity**: Hides complex service initialization behind simple interface
- **Consistent Test Environment**: Standardized setup across all E2E tests
- **Reusable Components**: Modular test building blocks for different scenarios

#### Testing Facade System

The tests utilize a three-tier facade system:

1. **TurnExecutionFacade**: Main orchestrator coordinating all services
2. **LLMServiceFacade**: AI decision-making services abstraction
3. **ActionServiceFacade**: Action discovery and validation services
4. **EntityServiceFacade**: Entity lifecycle and component management

### 2. Production Code Structure Revealed by Tests

   - **Role**: Main orchestrator for turn-based gameplay
   - **Dependencies**: TurnOrderService, EntityManager, EventBus, TurnHandlerResolver
   - **Responsibilities**: Turn advancement, round management, error handling

2. **ActionDiscoveryService** (`src/actions/actionDiscoveryService.js`)
   - **Role**: Discovers valid actions for entities
   - **Dependencies**: EntityManager, ActionPipelineOrchestrator, TraceContext
   - **Responsibilities**: Action validation, context preparation, pipeline delegation

3. **LLMDecisionProvider** (`src/turns/providers/llmDecisionProvider.js`)
   - **Role**: AI decision making using LLM services
   - **Dependencies**: LLMChooser, Logger, SafeEventDispatcher
   - **Responsibilities**: Delegating AI decisions to LLM implementation

4. **EntityManager** (inferred from facades)
   - **Role**: Entity lifecycle management
   - **Dependencies**: EventBus, DataRegistry, ScopeRegistry
   - **Responsibilities**: Entity CRUD, component management, query execution

```

### Coupling Analysis

#### Strengths
- **Well-defined interfaces**: Each service has clear contracts
- **Event-driven communication**: Reduces direct dependencies through EventBus
- **Modular separation**: Clear boundaries between different concerns
- **Dependency injection**: Flexible service composition

#### Areas of Concern
- **TurnManager complexity**: High cyclomatic complexity with multiple responsibilities
- **Cross-cutting concerns**: Logging and error handling scattered across services
- **Service orchestration**: Manual coordination between multiple services
- **Synchronization complexity**: Event-driven architecture requires careful state management

## Beneficial Architectural Improvements

### High Priority Improvements

#### 1. Enhanced Service Orchestration Pattern

**Current Issue**: Manual service coordination in facades and managers
**Proposed Solution**: Implement a Command/Query pattern with centralized orchestration

```javascript
// Current approach (in TurnExecutionFacade)
const availableActions = await this.#actionService.discoverActions(actorId);
const aiDecision = await this.#llmService.getAIDecision(actorId, { availableActions });
const validation = await this.#actionService.validateAction(aiDecision);

// Improved approach
const turnResult = await this.#orchestrator.execute(
  new ExecuteTurnCommand(actorId, context)
);
```

**Benefits**:
- Centralized business logic coordination
- Improved testability and maintainability
- Better error handling and rollback capabilities
- Clearer separation between orchestration and service logic

#### 2. Service Boundary Refinement

**Current Issue**: Services have overlapping responsibilities
**Proposed Solution**: Implement clear domain boundaries with dedicated coordinators

```javascript
// Domain-specific coordinators
class TurnExecutionCoordinator {
  async executeTurn(command) {
    // Orchestrates turn execution workflow
  }
}

class ActionProcessingCoordinator {
  async processActions(query) {
    // Handles action discovery and validation
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduced coupling between core services
- Clearer responsibility boundaries
- Improved maintainability and testing
- Better scalability for complex workflows

#### 3. Event Sourcing for Turn State

**Current Issue**: State management complexity in turn lifecycle
**Proposed Solution**: Implement event sourcing for turn progression

```javascript
class TurnEventStore {
  async appendEvent(turnId, event) {
    // Store turn events for replay and audit
  }
  
  async replayTurn(turnId) {
    // Reconstruct turn state from events
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Complete audit trail of turn progression
- Better error recovery and debugging
- Simplified state management
- Enhanced testing capabilities

### Medium Priority Improvements

#### 4. Improved Error Handling Strategy

**Current Issue**: Inconsistent error handling across services
**Proposed Solution**: Centralized error handling with typed exceptions

```javascript
class TurnExecutionError extends Error {
  constructor(phase, cause, context) {
    super(`Turn execution failed at ${phase}: ${cause.message}`);
    this.phase = phase;
    this.cause = cause;
    this.context = context;
  }
}

class ErrorHandler {
  async handleError(error, context) {
    // Centralized error processing and recovery
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Consistent error reporting and handling
- Better error recovery strategies
- Improved debugging and monitoring
- Cleaner service interfaces

#### 5. Performance Optimization Layer

**Current Issue**: No systematic performance monitoring
**Proposed Solution**: Implement performance measurement and optimization layer

```javascript
class PerformanceMonitor {
  async measureExecution(operation, context) {
    // Measure and record operation performance
  }
  
  generateMetrics() {
    // Provide performance insights
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Systematic performance monitoring
- Proactive bottleneck identification
- Data-driven optimization decisions
- Better resource utilization

### Low Priority Improvements

#### 6. Enhanced Caching Strategy

**Current Issue**: Limited caching in action discovery
**Proposed Solution**: Multi-layer caching with intelligent invalidation

```javascript
class CacheManager {
  async get(key, factory, ttl) {
    // Multi-tier caching with automatic invalidation
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Improved performance for repeated operations
- Reduced computational overhead
- Better resource utilization
- Configurable caching strategies

## Migration Strategy

### Incremental Implementation
1. **Implement alongside existing system**: New patterns work with current architecture
2. **Gradual migration**: Move services one at a time to new patterns
3. **Comprehensive testing**: Maintain E2E test coverage throughout migration
4. **Feature flags**: Control rollout of new architectural components

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain existing interfaces during transition
- Use adapter pattern to bridge old and new implementations
- Gradual deprecation of legacy patterns
