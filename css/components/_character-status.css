/* css/components/_character-status.css */

/*
 * Styles specific to the Character Status widget (#character-status-widget)
 * and its unique child elements.
 *
 * Common widget styles (overall box model, h3) are handled by _widgets-base.css.
 * Paragraphs (p) within this widget generally inherit from .panel p or body defaults.
 *
 * This file is for styles that are *uniquely* applied to children of
 * #character-status-widget beyond those common/inherited styles.
 * For example, if #player-health span or p tags *specifically within*
 * #character-status-widget required distinct styling (e.g., unique margins,
 * colors, font-styles not covered by base widget or panel typography),
 * those rules would be placed here.
 *
 * As of the last review (Ticket 29), no such overriding unique styles for
 * #character-status-widget's immediate children were identified in the
 * main style.css that weren't already covered by more general rules
 * or _widgets-base.css.
 *
 * Future specific styles for elements within #character-status-widget
 * (e.g., #player-health, #player-stamina, custom list items if any)
 * should be added here.

/* Example of how a specific style might look if needed in the future:
#character-status-widget #player-health {
    font-weight: bold;
    color: var(--positive-feedback-color);
    display: block;
    margin-bottom: var(--spacing-xs);
}

#character-status-widget p.status-effect {
    margin-left: var(--spacing-md);
    font-style: italic;
    color: var(--secondary-text-color);
}
