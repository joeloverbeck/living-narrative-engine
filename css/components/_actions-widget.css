/* --- Actions Widget: Layout for Action Buttons --- */

/*
  Layout styles for the #actions-widget, specifically how buttons
  are arranged within its #action-buttons child (e.g., flex properties).
  The appearance of the buttons themselves is handled by _buttons.css.
  Common widget container styles are from _widgets-base.css.
*/

#action-buttons {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: flex-start; /* Aligns buttons to the start of the container */
}

/* Context-specific button sizing/margin within the actions widget */
#action-buttons button {
  width: auto; /* Allow buttons to size based on their content */
  margin: var(--spacing-xs); /* Consistent small margin around each button */
}

/* Note: Styles for specific button states within #action-buttons
   (e.g., #action-buttons button.selected, #action-buttons button.selected:hover)
   should remain in the main style.css or be moved to _buttons.css
   if they are more about button appearance than action-widget layout.
   For this refactor, only the direct layout of #action-buttons and
   the base sizing/margin for buttons *within* it are moved here.
