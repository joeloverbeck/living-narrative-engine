# Anatomy System V2 - Kraken Loading Failure Diagnosis

## Problem Summary

The kraken anatomy system fails to load with the error:
```
BodyBlueprintFactory: Failed to create anatomy graph for blueprint 'anatomy:kraken':
Failed to process blueprint slot 'head': No entity definitions found matching anatomy requirements.
Need part type: 'kraken_head'. Allowed types: [head, cephalopod_head, kraken_head].
Required components: [anatomy:part, anatomy:sensory].
Required tags: [anatomy:part, anatomy:sensory].
Checked 247 entity definitions.
```

## Investigation Completed

### ‚úÖ Verified Correct
1. **Mod Loading Order**: anatomy mod loads before patrol mod ‚úì
2. **Manifest Inclusion**: kraken_head.entity.json is listed in anatomy mod manifest ‚úì
3. **Entity Definition Structure**: kraken_head has both required components ‚úì
   ```json
   {
     "id": "anatomy:kraken_head",
     "components": {
       "anatomy:part": { "subType": "kraken_head" },
       "anatomy:sensory": { ... }
     }
   }
   ```
4. **Blueprint Configuration**: Uses V2 with correct structure template ‚úì
5. **Recipe Pattern**: Correctly specifies tags for head appendage ‚úì

### üîç Diagnostic Logging Added

Added comprehensive logging to `src/anatomy/partSelectionService.js`:

1. **#findCandidates method** (lines 127-146):
   - Logs total entity definitions searched
   - Logs search parameters (partType, allowedTypes)
   - Specifically checks if kraken_head is in registry
   - Logs kraken_head entity data if found

2. **#meetsAllRequirements method** (lines 195-275):
   - Tracks kraken_head through all validation checks
   - Reports exactly which check fails:
     - No anatomy:part component
     - subType not in allowed types
     - subType doesn't match required partType
     - Missing required components
     - Missing required tags (from recipe)
   - Shows what components kraken_head actually has

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Open anatomy-visualizer.html** in browser
2. **Load kraken elder** from the entity list
3. **Open browser console** (F12)
4. **Look for diagnostic messages** starting with "PartSelectionService:"

### Expected Diagnostic Output

You should see one of these scenarios:

**Scenario A: Entity Not Loaded**
```
PartSelectionService: kraken_head entity definition NOT found in registry
```
‚Üí **Root Cause**: Entity loading issue
‚Üí **Fix**: Check entity definition loader

**Scenario B: Entity Loaded, Filtering Issue**
```
PartSelectionService: Found kraken_head entity definition
PartSelectionService: kraken_head FAILED - [specific reason]
```
‚Üí **Root Cause**: Validation logic issue
‚Üí **Fix**: Adjust the specific check that's failing

**Scenario C: Components Missing**
```
PartSelectionService: kraken_head FAILED - missing required tags: [anatomy:sensory]
hasComponents: ["anatomy:part", "core:name"]
```
‚Üí **Root Cause**: Component not being loaded from JSON
‚Üí **Fix**: Check entity definition loading preserves all components

## Most Likely Root Cause (Hypothesis)

Based on code analysis, the most likely issue is **Scenario B** where:
- Entity IS loaded (all 247 entity definitions include kraken_head)
- BUT one of the validation checks is incorrectly rejecting it

The diagnostic logs will reveal:
1. Which specific check is failing
2. What data kraken_head actually has when loaded
3. What the requirements are asking for

## Files Modified

- `src/anatomy/partSelectionService.js` - Added diagnostic logging at info level

## Build Status

‚úÖ Build completed successfully with diagnostic logging (info level)
- Diagnostics active in development mode
- Info-level logging prevents browser console hang
- Ready for browser testing

## After Testing

Once you see the console output, report back:
1. The specific "kraken_head FAILED" message
2. What components it shows kraken_head has
3. What requirements it shows are being checked

This will allow me to implement the precise fix needed.
