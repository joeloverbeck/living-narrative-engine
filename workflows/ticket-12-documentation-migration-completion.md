# Multi-Target Resolution Services Architecture

## Overview

The MultiTargetResolutionStage has been decomposed into 4 specialized services:

### Service Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[MultiTargetResolutionStage] --> B[TargetDependencyResolver]
    A --> C[LegacyTargetCompatibilityLayer]
    A --> D[ScopeContextBuilder]
    A --> E[TargetDisplayNameResolver]

    B --> F[Dependency Analysis & Ordering]
    C --> G[Legacy Action Support]
    D --> H[Context Creation & Enhancement]
    E --> I[Display Name Resolution]
```
````

### TargetDependencyResolver

- **Responsibility**: Analyze target dependencies and determine resolution order
- **Key Methods**: `getResolutionOrder()`, `validateDependencies()`
- **Dependencies**: Logger
- **Performance**: O(n²) for n targets, <10ms for typical cases

### LegacyTargetCompatibilityLayer

- **Responsibility**: Handle legacy single-target actions
- **Key Methods**: `isLegacyAction()`, `resolveLegacyTarget()`, `convertToMultiTargetFormat()`
- **Dependencies**: TargetResolutionService, EntityManager, Logger
- **Compatibility**: 100% backward compatible with existing legacy actions

### ScopeContextBuilder

- **Responsibility**: Build scope evaluation contexts
- **Key Methods**: `buildScopeContext()`, `buildContextForSpecificPrimary()`
- **Dependencies**: TargetContextBuilder, EntityManager, Logger
- **Integration**: Works with existing TargetContextBuilder

### TargetDisplayNameResolver

- **Responsibility**: Resolve entity display names
- **Key Methods**: `getEntityDisplayName()`, `getEntityDisplayNames()`
- **Dependencies**: EntityManager, Logger
- **Features**: Batch processing, configurable fallbacks

### Task 12.2: Migration Guide Creation (1.5 hours)

**Objective**: Create comprehensive migration guide for developers

**File to Create**: `docs/migration/multi-target-resolution-migration-guide.md`

**Migration Guide Contents**:
- [ ] **Overview**: What changed and why
- [ ] **Breaking Changes**: Any API changes (should be none)
- [ ] **Service Usage**: How to use the new services directly
- [ ] **Testing**: How to test code that uses the services
- [ ] **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
- [ ] **Rollback Procedure**: How to rollback if needed

**Implementation Details**:

```markdown
# MultiTargetResolutionStage Migration Guide

## Overview

The MultiTargetResolutionStage has been refactored from a 734-line monolith into 4 specialized services. This change is **100% backward compatible** - no existing code needs to be modified.

## What Changed

### Before (Monolithic)
```javascript
class MultiTargetResolutionStage {
  // 734 lines of mixed responsibilities
  #getResolutionOrder() { /* 37 lines */ }
  #resolveLegacyTarget() { /* 70 lines */ }
  #buildScopeContext() { /* 18 lines */ }
  #getEntityDisplayName() { /* 17 lines */ }
  // ... many other methods
}
````

### After (Service-Oriented)

```javascript
class MultiTargetResolutionStage {
  // ~150 lines of orchestration
  constructor({
    targetDependencyResolver,
    legacyTargetCompatibilityLayer,
    scopeContextBuilder,
    targetDisplayNameResolver,
    // ...
  }) {
    // Service delegation
  }
}
```

## Using Services Directly

If you need to use the services directly in your code:

```javascript
// Get services from DI container
const dependencyResolver = container.resolve(tokens.ITargetDependencyResolver);
const legacyLayer = container.resolve(tokens.ILegacyTargetCompatibilityLayer);

// Use services
const order = dependencyResolver.getResolutionOrder(targetDefinitions);
const isLegacy = legacyLayer.isLegacyAction(actionDef);
```

## Testing with New Services

### Unit Testing Services

```javascript
import { TargetDependencyResolver } from './services/implementations/TargetDependencyResolver.js';

describe('My Component', () => {
  let mockDependencyResolver;

  beforeEach(() => {
    mockDependencyResolver = {
      getResolutionOrder: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(['primary', 'secondary']),
    };
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing

```javascript
// Services are automatically injected - no changes needed
const result = await multiTargetStage.executeInternal(context);
expect(result.success).toBe(true);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Service not registered" error

**Solution**: Ensure all services are registered in DI container.

### Issue: Different behavior from original

**Solution**: This should not happen. Please file a bug report with specific test case.

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are discovered:

1. **Immediate Rollback**:

   ```bash
   git revert <decomposition-commit-hash>
   ```

2. **Verify Rollback**:

   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

3. **Report Issues**: Create detailed bug report with reproduction steps

### Task 12.3: API Documentation Update (1 hour)

**Objective**: Update all JSDoc and API documentation

**Files to Update**:
- All service implementation files
- Interface definition files
- Container configuration files

**Documentation Standards**:
- [ ] Complete JSDoc for all public methods
- [ ] Parameter and return type documentation
- [ ] Usage examples in complex methods
- [ ] Error conditions documented
- [ ] Performance characteristics noted

**Example Enhancement**:

```javascript
/**
 * Analyze target definitions and return resolution order
 *
 * Uses topological sorting to determine the correct order for resolving targets
 * based on their contextFrom dependencies. Detects circular dependencies and
 * provides detailed error information for debugging.
 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * const targetDefs = {
 *   primary: { scope: 'actor.partners', placeholder: 'target' },
 *   secondary: { scope: 'primary.items', contextFrom: 'primary', placeholder: 'item' }
 * };
 *
 * const order = resolver.getResolutionOrder(targetDefs);
 * // Returns: ['primary', 'secondary']
 * ```
 *
 * @param {Object.<string, TargetDefinition>} targetDefinitions - Map of target key to definition
 * @returns {string[]} Dependency-ordered target keys
 * @throws {ServiceError} If circular dependencies detected or invalid definitions
 *
 * @performance O(n²) worst case, typically O(n) for most dependency graphs
 * @since 1.0.0 - Extracted from MultiTargetResolutionStage
 */
getResolutionOrder(targetDefinitions) {
  // Implementation...
}
````

### Task 12.4: Final Cleanup and Deployment Preparation (0.5 hours)

**Objective**: Clean up temporary files and prepare for deployment

**Cleanup Tasks**:

- [ ] Remove any temporary test files or debugging code
- [ ] Verify all placeholder implementations are replaced
- [ ] Update package.json if needed
- [ ] Create deployment checklist
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
