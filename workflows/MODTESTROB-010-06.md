# MODTESTROB-010-06: Validate Batch 1 Migration and Update Migration Guide

## Summary
Consolidate the Batch 1 migrations by running focused regression suites, updating documentation, and capturing any helper follow-ups for later batches.

## Dependencies
- MODTESTROB-010-02 through MODTESTROB-010-05 completed.

## Tasks
1. Execute targeted regression sweeps to ensure positioning and items suites remain stable:
   ```bash
   npm run test:integration -- tests/integration/mods/positioning
   npm run test:integration -- tests/integration/mods/items
   ```
2. Re-run the adoption metrics to confirm reductions in legacy usage and new matcher adoption:
   ```bash
   rg -l "ModEntityBuilder" tests/integration/mods | wc -l
   rg -l "ModAssertionHelpers" tests/integration/mods | wc -l
   rg -l "domainMatchers.js" tests/integration/mods | wc -l
   ```
3. Document before/after counts, notable refactor lessons, and any required helper enhancements in `docs/testing/MODTESTROB-009-migration-guide.md` under the Batch 1 section.
4. File follow-up tasks (if necessary) for helper improvements or remaining edge cases uncovered during migration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Regression commands complete successfully with passing tests.
- Updated counts demonstrate decreased reliance on manual builders/assertion helpers and non-zero domain matcher usage.
- Migration guide reflects Batch 1 outcomes and notes any open issues for future batches.

## Validation
- Attach terminal output for regression runs and updated `rg` counts.
- Link or reference any newly created follow-up tickets addressing helper enhancements.
