# Ticket 07: Service Integration Testing

**Epic**: MultiTargetResolutionStage Decomposition  
**Phase**: 2 - Context & Display Services  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours  
**Dependencies**: Tickets 01-06 (All services implemented)  
**Assignee**: QA Engineer

## 📋 Summary

Create comprehensive integration tests for all Phase 1 and Phase 2 services. Verify service interactions, dependency injection configuration, and end-to-end workflows through the service layer.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Verify all services integrate properly through DI container
- Test service interactions and data flow
- Validate error propagation between services
- Ensure performance characteristics are maintained
- Create integration test patterns for Phase 3

## 🏗️ Implementation Tasks

### Task 7.1: Service Integration Test Suite (2 hours)

**File to Create**: `tests/integration/actions/pipeline/services/ServiceIntegration.test.js`

**Test Categories**:

- [ ] DI container resolution for all services
- [ ] Service-to-service communication patterns
- [ ] Error propagation and handling
- [ ] Performance integration benchmarks
- [ ] Resource cleanup and lifecycle management

### Task 7.2: End-to-End Service Workflow Tests (1 hour)

**File to Create**: `tests/integration/actions/pipeline/services/ServiceWorkflow.test.js`

**Test Scenarios**:

- [ ] Complete target resolution workflow using all services
- [ ] Legacy action processing through service layer
- [ ] Multi-target resolution with complex dependencies
- [ ] Error recovery and graceful degradation

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All services resolve correctly through DI container
- [ ] Service interactions preserve data integrity
- [ ] Error handling maintains proper error context
- [ ] Performance within acceptable bounds
- [ ] Integration tests pass consistently
