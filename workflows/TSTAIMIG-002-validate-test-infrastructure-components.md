# TSTAIMIG-002: Validate Test Infrastructure Components

## Objective

Perform deep validation of test infrastructure components identified in TSTAIMIG-001, ensuring they meet the specific requirements for AI-assisted migration and documenting their actual capabilities versus specification assumptions.

## Background

Following the initial infrastructure validation, this ticket focuses on detailed testing and validation of each component to ensure they can support the migration patterns described in the specification. This includes API compatibility testing, behavioral validation, and performance baseline establishment.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Component API Testing

1. **Create Test Suite for Each Component**
   ```bash
   # Create validation tests
   touch tests/integration/infrastructure/modTestHandlerFactory.validation.test.js
   touch tests/integration/infrastructure/modTestFixture.validation.test.js
   touch tests/integration/infrastructure/modEntityBuilder.validation.test.js
   touch tests/integration/infrastructure/modAssertionHelpers.validation.test.js
   ```

2. **Test Each Method Individually**
   - Create small tests for each public method
   - Validate input/output behavior
   - Test error conditions
   - Document actual API signatures

### Step 2: Integration Pattern Testing

1. **End-to-End Migration Test**
   - Select a simple test file (e.g., from exercise category)
   - Perform complete migration using infrastructure
   - Document all steps and challenges
   - Validate final result works correctly

2. **Category Pattern Validation**
   - Test infrastructure against each category's patterns
   - Validate schema validation patterns (exercise)
   - Validate runtime integration patterns (violence)
   - Validate complex entity patterns (intimacy, sex, positioning)

### Step 3: Performance Baseline

1. **Establish Metrics**
   - Measure infrastructure overhead
   - Test migration time for sample files
   - Measure test execution performance
   - Document resource usage

2. **Compare Against Manual Patterns**
   - Run original tests and measure performance
   - Run migrated tests and compare
   - Validate <30% performance regression target
   - Document optimization opportunities

### Step 4: API Documentation

1. **Document Actual APIs**
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Include all method signatures
   - Document parameters and return values
   - Include usage examples

2. **Migration Pattern Documentation**
