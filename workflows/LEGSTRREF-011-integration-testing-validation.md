# LEGSTRREF-011: Integration Testing & Validation

## Metadata
- **Ticket ID**: LEGSTRREF-011
- **Phase**: 4 - Dependency Optimization
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Effort**: 1-2 days
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Dependencies**: LEGSTRREF-010
- **Blocks**: LEGSTRREF-012

## Problem Statement

Comprehensive validation is required to ensure the refactoring has not introduced behavioral changes or performance regressions.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Run Full Test Suite

```bash
npm run test:ci
```

Verify:
- All unit tests pass
- All integration tests pass
- All e2e tests pass
- Test coverage meets targets (>95%)

### Step 2: Performance Benchmarking

Compare performance before/after refactoring:

```bash
npm run test:performance -- tests/performance/actions/
```

Metrics to verify:
- No performance degradation (within 5% margin)
- Memory usage unchanged
- CPU usage unchanged

### Step 3: Integration Smoke Tests

Run specific integration tests for action formatting:

```bash
npm run test:integration -- tests/integration/actions/
```

Verify:
- Action formatting still works end-to-end
- Trace integration works
- Error handling works
- Multi-target actions work
- Single-target actions work

### Step 4: Regression Testing

Create behavior snapshots and compare:

```bash
# Before refactoring (from git)
git show HEAD~N:src/actions/pipeline/stages/actionFormatting/legacy/LegacyStrategy.js > old-behavior.js

# After refactoring
# Run same inputs, compare outputs
```

### Step 5: Code Coverage Verification

```bash
npm run test:unit -- --coverage
```

Verify coverage targets:
- Line coverage: >95%
- Branch coverage: >90%
- Function coverage: 100%

### Step 6: Code Quality Metrics

Verify improvements:
- Lines of Code reduced by ~20%
- Cyclomatic Complexity reduced by ~50%
- Code Duplication: 0%
- Method Size (max): <50 lines

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ All tests pass (unit, integration, e2e)
- ✅ Test coverage >95% lines, >90% branches
- ✅ No performance regression (<5% variance)
- ✅ No behavioral changes detected
- ✅ Code quality metrics meet targets
- ✅ Integration smoke tests pass
