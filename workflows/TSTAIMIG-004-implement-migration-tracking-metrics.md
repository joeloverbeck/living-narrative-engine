     categories: [
       {
         name: 'exercise',
         fileCount: 2,
         status: 'pending|in_progress|completed',

           inProgress: 0,
           completed: 0,
           validated: 0
         }
       }
       // ... other categories
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **File Migration Tracking**
   ```javascript
   // Individual file migration record
   {
     fileId: 'exercise/show_off_biceps_action.test.js',
