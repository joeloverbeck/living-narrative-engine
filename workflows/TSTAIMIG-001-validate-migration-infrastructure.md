# TSTAIMIG-001: Validate Migration Infrastructure

## Objective

Establish and validate the foundational infrastructure required for AI-assisted test suite migration, ensuring all necessary components exist and function correctly before beginning the migration process.

## Background

This is the first critical step in the test suite migration project. Before migrating any test files, we must verify that all required infrastructure components are available, properly implemented, and ready for use. This validation prevents migration failures and ensures consistent patterns across all subsequent migration work.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Inventory Infrastructure Components

1. **Check File Existence**
   ```bash
   ls -la tests/common/mods/ModTestHandlerFactory.js
   ls -la tests/common/mods/ModTestFixture.js
   ls -la tests/common/mods/ModEntityBuilder.js
   ls -la tests/common/mods/ModAssertionHelpers.js
   ```

2. **Verify Base Classes**
   ```bash
   find tests -name "*TestBase*" -type f
   grep -r "ModActionTestBase" tests/
   ```

3. **Check Utility Functions**
   ```bash
   ls -la src/utils/dependencyUtils.js
   ls -la src/utils/macroUtils.js
   grep -r "createRuleTestEnvironment" tests/
   ```

### Step 2: API Validation

1. **Test ModEntityBuilder API**
   - Create simple test to verify fluent API methods
   - Validate constructor behavior (direct ID, not createActor())
   - Test method chaining functionality

2. **Test ModTestFixture Integration**
   - Verify auto-loading capabilities
   - Test action, rule, condition file loading
   - Validate method signatures against spec

3. **Test ModAssertionHelpers**
   - Verify `assertActionSuccess()` signature and behavior
   - Verify `assertComponentAdded()` signature (with entityManager parameter)
   - Test event validation patterns

### Step 3: Integration Testing

1. **Create Test Migration Example**
   - Select one simple test file as validation target
   - Attempt basic migration using identified infrastructure
   - Document any API discrepancies found

2. **Validate Test Execution**
   - Ensure migrated example executes successfully
   - Verify performance expectations
   - Confirm code reduction achievable

### Step 4: Documentation of Findings

1. **API Documentation**
   - Document actual API signatures found
   - Note any differences from specification
   - Record method availability and behavior

2. **Gap Analysis**
   - Identify missing components
   - Document incomplete implementations  
   - Note any blocking issues for migration

3. **Infrastructure Report**
   - Create comprehensive status report
   - Include recommendations for missing pieces
   - Provide guidance for subsequent tickets

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Verify infrastructure files exist
npm run test:unit tests/unit/common/mods/
npm run test:integration tests/integration/common/mods/

# Test basic infrastructure integration
npm run test:single tests/integration/infrastructure/

# Validate utility functions
npm run test:unit src/utils/dependencyUtils.test.js
npm run test:unit src/utils/macroUtils.test.js
```

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics

- [ ] **Component Availability**: 100% of specified components exist or alternatives identified
- [ ] **API Compatibility**: >90% of expected methods available with documented signatures  
- [ ] **Test Execution**: Infrastructure validation tests pass with >95% success rate
- [ ] **Performance Baseline**: Establish baseline metrics for comparison in later tickets

### Qualitative Metrics

- [ ] **Usability**: Infrastructure components are easy to use for migration purposes
- [ ] **Consistency**: Components follow consistent patterns and conventions
- [ ] **Documentation**: All components have clear usage patterns documented
- [ ] **Completeness**: All critical migration patterns are supportable

## Deliverables

1. **Infrastructure Validation Report**
   - Component availability status
   - API documentation and discrepancies
   - Integration test results
   - Gap analysis and recommendations

2. **Updated Migration Guidelines** (if needed)
   - Corrections to API assumptions
   - Additional patterns discovered
   - Modified migration approaches

3. **Infrastructure Test Suite**
   - Tests validating all components work properly
   - Integration tests for migration patterns
   - Performance baseline measurements

## Dependencies

- No dependencies (first ticket in sequence)
- Must be completed before any migration work begins
- Sets foundation for all subsequent TSTAIMIG tickets

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Issue**: ModTestFixture not found
- Check alternative locations in tests/common/
- Look for similar fixture patterns
- Document actual location and naming

**Issue**: API methods don't match specification  
- Document actual method signatures
- Identify alternative approaches
- Update migration patterns accordingly

**Issue**: Base classes not implemented
- Check for similar base class patterns
- Document extension points available
- Plan base class implementation if needed

**Issue**: Integration tests fail
- Check dependency injection patterns
- Verify test environment setup
- Validate helper function integrations

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Missing core infrastructure components could block all migration work
- **Medium Risk**: API differences requiring pattern adjustments
- **Low Risk**: Minor implementation differences requiring documentation updates
