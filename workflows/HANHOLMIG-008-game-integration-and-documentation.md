# HANHOLMIG-008: Game Integration and Documentation

**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Time**: 1-1.5 hours
**Risk Level**: Low (final integration and documentation)

## Overview

This ticket completes the hand-holding mod migration by integrating the mod into the game, testing in-game functionality, creating mod-specific documentation, updating the changelog, and performing final review. This is the final step before merging the feature branch.

## Prerequisites

- [x] **HANHOLMIG-001 through HANHOLMIG-007 complete**: All migration phases finished
- [x] **HANHOLMIG-007 validations pass**: All quality gates met
- [ ] Clean git working directory
- [ ] Feature branch: `feature/hand-holding-mod-migration` active

## Detailed Steps

### Phase 1: Game Integration

#### Step 1.1: Update game.json

**File to edit**: `data/game.json`

**Current mod list** (from spec):
```json
{
  "mods": [
    "core",
    "movement",
    "companionship",
    "positioning",
    "items",
    "anatomy",
    "clothing",
    "exercise",
    "distress",
    "violence",
    "seduction",
    "affection",
    "caressing",
    "kissing",
    "p_erotica"
  ]
}
```

**Insert hand_holding after affection**:
```json
{
  "mods": [
    "core",
    "movement",
    "companionship",
    "positioning",
    "items",
    "anatomy",
    "clothing",
    "exercise",
    "distress",
    "violence",
    "seduction",
    "affection",
    "hand_holding",
    "caressing",
    "kissing",
    "p_erotica"
  ]
}
```

**Rationale for placement**:
- After affection: Maintains logical grouping (progression from general affection to specific gestures)
- Before caressing: Hand-holding is less intimate than caressing/kissing
- After dependencies: core and positioning load before hand_holding

**Validation**:
```bash
# Verify game.json is valid JSON
cat data/game.json | jq '.'

# Verify hand_holding is in the list
grep "hand_holding" data/game.json
# Should find: "hand_holding",
```

#### Step 1.2: Test Game Loads Successfully

**Start the game**:
```bash
npm run start
```

**Check browser console for**:
- ✅ hand_holding mod loads successfully
- ✅ No errors during mod loading
- ✅ All mods load in correct order
- ✅ No missing dependency errors

**Expected console output**:
```
Loading mod: core
Loading mod: movement
...
Loading mod: affection
Loading mod: hand_holding  ← Should appear here
Loading mod: caressing
...
All mods loaded successfully
```

### Phase 2: In-Game Functionality Testing

#### Step 2.1: Test Action Discovery

**Manual testing steps**:
1. Start game with `npm run start`
2. Create test scenario with two actors close to each other
3. Check action discovery panel
4. Verify hand-holding actions appear:
   - Hold Hand
   - Squeeze Hand Reassuringly (requires existing hand-holding)
   - Warm Hands Between Yours (requires existing hand-holding)

**Expected results**:
- Hold Hand action is discoverable when actors are close
- Action button displays with Velvet Twilight color scheme (#2c0e37 background, #ffebf0 text)
- Action buttons are visually distinct from affection mod actions (Soft Purple)

#### Step 2.2: Test Action Execution

**Test scenario: Hold Hand**:
1. Execute "Hold Hand" action between two actors
2. Verify components are added:
   - Actor receives `hand_holding:holding_hand` component
   - Target receives `hand_holding:hand_held` component
3. Check narrative output reflects action

**Test scenario: Squeeze Hand Reassuringly**:
1. Ensure two actors are holding hands (from previous test)
2. Execute "Squeeze Hand Reassuringly" action
3. Verify action executes successfully
4. Verify hand-holding state is maintained

**Test scenario: Warm Hands Between Yours**:
1. Ensure two actors are holding hands
2. Execute "Warm Hands Between Yours" action
3. Verify action executes successfully
4. Verify hand-holding state is maintained

#### Step 2.3: Test Visual Properties

**Manual verification**:
1. Locate hand-holding action buttons in UI
2. Verify normal state colors:
   - Background: #2c0e37 (dark purple)
   - Text: #ffebf0 (light pink)
3. Hover over buttons and verify hover colors:
   - Background: #451952 (lighter purple)
   - Text: #f3e5f5 (light purple-white)
4. Verify text is readable (WCAG AAA compliance)

**Accessibility check**:
- Text should be clearly readable against background
- Hover state should be obviously different from normal state
- No color-only information conveyed

### Phase 3: Test Suite Verification

#### Step 3.1: Run Hand Holding Integration Tests

**Now that mod is in game.json, tests should pass**:
```bash
npm run test:integration -- tests/integration/mods/hand_holding/
```

**Expected result**: All 7 hand_holding integration tests pass

**Tests that should pass**:
1. hold_hand_action.test.js
2. hold_hand_action_discovery.test.js
3. hold_hand_first_time.integration.test.js
4. squeeze_hand_reassuringly_action.test.js
5. squeeze_hand_reassuringly_action_discovery.test.js
6. warm_hands_between_yours_action.test.js
7. warm_hands_between_yours_action_discovery.test.js

#### Step 3.2: Run Full Test Suite

**Final verification**:
```bash
npm run test:ci
```

**Expected result**: All tests pass, including hand_holding tests

**Coverage verification**:
- Branch coverage: ≥80%
- Function coverage: ≥90%
- Line coverage: ≥90%

### Phase 4: Documentation

#### Step 4.1: Create Mod-Specific README

**File to create**: `data/mods/hand_holding/README.md`

**Content**:
```markdown
# Hand Holding Mod

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Dependencies**: core, positioning

## Overview

The Hand Holding mod provides sophisticated state-based hand-holding interactions with bidirectional relationship tracking. It enables actors to establish, maintain, and interact with hand-holding states through a variety of actions.

## Features

### Components

- **holding_hand**: Marks an entity as actively holding another's hand
- **hand_held**: Marks an entity whose hand is being held

### Actions

1. **Hold Hand**
   - Establishes hand-holding state between actor and target
   - Requires: Both actors close and facing each other (or actor behind target)
   - Effect: Adds `holding_hand` component to actor, `hand_held` to target
   - Color Scheme: Velvet Twilight (luxurious intimate gesture)

2. **Squeeze Hand Reassuringly**
   - Expresses comfort through hand pressure
   - Requires: Existing hand-holding state
   - Effect: Narrative expression, maintains hand-holding state

3. **Warm Hands Between Yours**
   - Tender gesture of warming target's hands
   - Requires: Existing hand-holding state
   - Effect: Narrative expression, maintains hand-holding state

## State Machine

```
[No State]
    ↓ hold_hand
[holding_hand ⟷ hand_held]
    ↓ squeeze_hand_reassuringly / warm_hands_between_yours
[holding_hand ⟷ hand_held] (maintained)
```

## Future Extensibility

Planned future actions:
- **release_hand**: Gracefully end hand-holding state
- **pull_hand_away**: Abruptly break hand-holding (tension/discomfort)
- **intertwine_fingers**: Enhance intimacy (adds `fingers_intertwined`)
- **swing_hands**: Playful variation
- **lift_hand_to_lips**: Romantic escalation

## Color Scheme

**Velvet Twilight** - Luxurious, intimate, elegant nightfall

- Normal: Background #2c0e37, Text #ffebf0
- Hover: Background #451952, Text #f3e5f5
- Contrast: 15.01:1 (normal), 11.45:1 (hover) - WCAG AAA

## Technical Details

### Dependencies

- **core**: Base entity and component systems
- **positioning**: Closeness components for proximity requirements

### Scope References

- Uses `positioning:close_actors_facing_each_other_or_behind_target` for action discovery
