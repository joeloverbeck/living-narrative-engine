# Ticket 08: Dependency Injection Configuration

**Epic**: MultiTargetResolutionStage Decomposition  
**Phase**: 2 - Context & Display Services  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours  
**Dependencies**: Tickets 01-06 (All services implemented)  
**Assignee**: Developer

## 📋 Summary

Complete the dependency injection configuration for all services created in Phases 1 and 2. Ensure proper registration, dependency resolution, and lifecycle management for all pipeline services.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Register all services in DI container with proper dependencies
- Configure service lifecycles and scoping
- Create factory patterns for service creation
- Validate container configuration with comprehensive tests
- Prepare container for Phase 3 services

## 🏗️ Implementation Tasks

### Task 8.1: Complete Service Registration (1 hour)

**File to Modify**: `src/dependencyInjection/containerConfig.js`

**Requirements**:

- [ ] Replace all placeholder registrations with actual implementations
- [ ] Configure proper dependency chains
- [ ] Set appropriate service lifecycles (singleton vs transient)
- [ ] Add service factory registrations

### Task 8.2: Container Validation Tests (1 hour)

**File to Create**: `tests/integration/dependencyInjection/PipelineServiceRegistration.test.js`

**Test Coverage**:

- [ ] All services resolve correctly
- [ ] Dependency chains are properly satisfied
- [ ] No circular dependencies in container
- [ ] Service lifecycle behavior is correct
- [ ] Factory patterns work as expected

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] All services registered and resolvable
- [ ] No container configuration errors
- [ ] Service dependencies properly injected
- [ ] Container performance acceptable
- [ ] Configuration supports testing scenarios
