# DEPSAN-001: Decide Fate of `strictObjectProxy` Utility and Remove Depcruise Orphan Warning

## Summary
The `src/utils/strictObjectProxy.js` module is currently flagged by dependency-cruiser as an orphan (no-orphans rule). Investigate whether this proxy helper should be integrated into the runtime (for example by wrapping configuration objects or DI containers) or removed entirely if obsolete. Deliver a plan that either reintroduces the helper in a meaningful location or deletes it along with any dead references/documentation so the no-orphans warning is resolved.

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with how depcruise reports orphan modules.
- Ability to run `npm run depcruise` and Jest unit tests locally.

## Tasks
1. Search the repository history and codebase to understand why `strictObjectProxy` was added (e.g., review `git log -- src/utils/strictObjectProxy.js`). Document any intended usage patterns you discover.
2. Audit current runtime and tests to confirm no active imports exist and whether similar guard logic lives elsewhere (e.g., inside dependency/validation utilities).
3. Decide on a resolution path:
   - **If the helper is valuable:** identify concrete call sites (configuration objects, service registries, etc.) where adding the strict proxy improves error diagnostics. Add the imports, wire the proxy in, and cover with targeted tests.
   - **If obsolete:** delete `strictObjectProxy.js`, clean up any exports or documentation mentioning it, and ensure tests still pass.
4. Update or add unit tests covering whichever path you chose (new behaviour or confirming removal).
5. Run `npm run depcruise` and confirm the orphan warning disappears. Capture the command output for validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No-orphans warning for `src/utils/strictObjectProxy.js` is eliminated without introducing new dependency-cruiser violations.
- Either a documented, tested usage of the strict proxy exists, or the file is cleanly removed.
- Tests relevant to the touched area cover the change (new assertions or updated snapshots as needed).

## Validation
- Attach the `npm run depcruise` output showing the orphan warning is gone.
- Provide evidence of passing tests (e.g., `npm run test:unit` if logic changed).
