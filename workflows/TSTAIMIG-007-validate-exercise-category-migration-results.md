### Quality Risks

**Risk**: Success criteria met but quality actually degraded
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive quality assessment, multiple validation approaches

**Risk**: Infrastructure integration appears successful but has hidden issues
- **Mitigation**: Stress testing, edge case validation, long-term monitoring
