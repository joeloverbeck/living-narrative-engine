Anatomy System Refactoring Report

Based on my analysis of the production code in the anatomy system, here are the five modules prioritized for refactoring, with detailed reasoning:


  ---
3. BodyGraphService (Medium Priority)

File: /src/anatomy/bodyGraphService.js (560 lines)

Current Issues:

- Cache management mixed with business logic
- Recursive algorithms without depth limits
- No abstraction for graph operations
- Event dispatching mixed with core logic
- Manual graph traversal repeated in multiple methods

Recommended Refactoring:

1. Extract graph algorithms to a GraphAlgorithms utility class
2. Separate cache management into AnatomyCacheManager
3. Implement Visitor pattern for graph traversal
4. Create dedicated graph query interface
5. Add depth limits and cycle detection to all recursive operations

Expected Benefits:

- Reusable graph algorithms
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Safer recursive operations
- Better performance with optimized algorithms

Risk: Medium - Graph operations are complex but well-understood

4. BodyDescriptionComposer (Medium Priority)

File: /src/anatomy/bodyDescriptionComposer.js (294 lines)

Current Issues:

- Hard-coded defaults throughout the class
- Complex conditional logic for paired parts
- String manipulation mixed with business logic
- No abstraction for formatting rules
- Tight coupling to specific component structures

Recommended Refactoring:

1. Extract formatting rules to configuration
2. Implement Strategy pattern for different part grouping strategies
3. Create DescriptionTemplate abstraction
4. Separate text formatting from description logic
5. Remove hard-coded part type lists

Expected Benefits:

- Configurable description formats
- Easier to add new part types
- Testable formatting logic
- Reduced maintenance burden

Risk: Low - Mostly affects output formatting

  ---
5. GraphIntegrityValidator (Lower Priority)

File: /src/anatomy/graphIntegrityValidator.js (446 lines)

Current Issues:

- Large validation methods with multiple responsibilities
- Complex constraint checking logic
- No validation rule abstraction
- Error accumulation without categorization
- Limited extensibility for new validation rules

Recommended Refactoring:

1. Implement Chain of Responsibility for validation rules
2. Create validation rule classes:
   - SocketLimitRule
   - RecipeConstraintRule
   - CycleDetectionRule
   - JointConsistencyRule
3. Add validation context object to track state
4. Categorize errors by severity and type

Expected Benefits:

- Extensible validation system
- Clearer validation logic
- Better error reporting
- Easier to test individual rules

Risk: Low - Validation is well-isolated

Implementation Order

1. Start with GraphIntegrityValidator (lowest risk, good warm-up)
2. Then BodyDescriptionComposer (low risk, visible improvements)
3. Follow with BodyGraphService (foundation for other refactorings)
4. Next AnatomyGenerationService (prepares for the big one)
5. Finally BodyBlueprintFactory (highest impact, highest risk)

This order allows for:
- Progressive risk escalation
- Building foundational improvements first
- Learning the codebase through smaller refactorings
- Maintaining system stability throughout
