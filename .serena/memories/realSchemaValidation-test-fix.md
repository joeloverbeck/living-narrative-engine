# Fix for realSchemaValidation.test.js

## Problem

The test was failing because it made incorrect assumptions about the DISPATCH_THOUGHT operation schema. Specifically, it was passing `notes` as a string value (`'{event.payload.notes}'`) when the schema requires it to be an array.

## Root Cause

The test data was incorrectly structured:

- The `notes` parameter in DISPATCH_THOUGHT must be an array of note objects
- The test was passing a template string instead
- This is an optional field, so it can be omitted entirely

## Solution

1. Removed the `notes` field from the test data since it's optional
2. Updated both the individual operation test and the rule validation test
3. Added comments explaining that notes must be an array when provided

## Key Learnings

- The schema validation is working correctly
- The test assumptions were wrong, not the production code
- The `notes` field in DISPATCH_THOUGHT is optional but must be an array when present
- Each note in the array must be an object with at least a `text` field

## Files Modified

- `tests/unit/validation/realSchemaValidation.test.js` - Fixed test data structure
