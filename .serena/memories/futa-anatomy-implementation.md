# Futa Anatomy Blueprint Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented futanari (futa) anatomy blueprint for the Living Narrative Engine, combining female upper body characteristics (breasts) with male lower body characteristics (penis and testicles).

## Files Created

### 1. Torso Entity

- **File**: `data/mods/anatomy/entities/definitions/human_futa_torso.entity.json`
- **Purpose**: Defines a torso with combined sockets from both male and female anatomy
- **Key Features**:
  - Breast sockets (left_chest, right_chest) from female
  - Genital sockets (penis, left_testicle, right_testicle) from male
  - All standard humanoid sockets (neck, shoulders, hips, etc.)

### 2. Blueprint

- **File**: `data/mods/anatomy/blueprints/human_futa.blueprint.json`
- **Purpose**: Defines the anatomy blueprint for futa body type
- **Key Features**:
  - Composes from humanoid_core for base functionality
  - Defines breast slots mapping to chest sockets
  - Defines genital slots mapping to male genital sockets
  - Clothing slot mappings:
    - torso_upper: Uses anatomySockets (female-style) to cover breasts
    - torso_lower: Includes male genitals in coverage
    - full_body: Includes breasts in blueprint slots

### 3. Recipe

- **File**: `data/mods/anatomy/recipes/human_futa.recipe.json`
- **Purpose**: Defines how to generate a futa character
- **Key Features**:
  - References the futa blueprint
  - Sets torso to prefer human_futa_torso
  - Patterns for breasts and testicles
  - Uses standard humanoid parts for other body parts

### 4. Tests

- **File**: `tests/unit/anatomy/human_futa.blueprint.test.js`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive test coverage for the futa anatomy implementation
- **Test Coverage**: 17 tests covering blueprint structure, clothing mappings, torso entity, and recipe

## Integration

Updated `data/mods/anatomy/mod-manifest.json` to include:

- human_futa_torso.entity.json in entities.definitions
- human_futa.blueprint.json in blueprints
- human_futa.recipe.json in recipes

## Validation

- All JSON files validated against their schemas
- All tests passing (17/17)
- No linting errors

## Implementation Notes

- Clothing slot mappings follow existing patterns:
  - Female-style torso_upper (anatomySockets approach)
  - Male-style torso_lower (includes genitals)
- Maintains full compatibility with existing anatomy system
- Ready for use in character creation
