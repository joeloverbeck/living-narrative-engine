# Anatomy Test Fix Summary

## Problem

Two integration test files were failing due to a method name mismatch:

- `tests/integration/anatomy/errorHandling.integration.test.js`
- `tests/integration/anatomy/runtimeBehavior.integration.test.js`

The tests were calling `anatomyInitService.dispose()` but the `AnatomyInitializationService` class actually has a `destroy()` method.

## Root Cause

The `AnatomyInitializationService` was recently modified to use sequential anatomy generation (with a queue) to avoid recursion errors. During this change, the cleanup method is named `destroy()` but the integration tests were still calling `dispose()`.

## Solution Applied

1. Fixed integration tests by replacing `dispose()` with `destroy()`:
   - errorHandling.integration.test.js: 1 occurrence at line 423
   - runtimeBehavior.integration.test.js: 2 occurrences at lines 489 and 561

2. Also updated unit tests to use `destroy()` instead of `dispose()`:
   - anatomyInitializationService.test.js
   - anatomyInitializationService.methodCoverage.test.js
   - anatomyInitializationService.coverage.test.js
   - anatomyInitializationService.pendingGenerations.test.js

## Result

- All 33 integration test suites now pass
- Integration tests are correctly calling the `destroy()` method

## Note

Some unit tests for `AnatomyInitializationService` may still need adjustments due to the behavioral changes from concurrent to sequential generation, but the core issue with the integration tests has been resolved.
