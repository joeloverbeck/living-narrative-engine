# Fixed mouthEngagementPrerequisites.test.js

## Issue
The test suite was failing because it assumed prerequisites had a nested structure with a `condition` wrapper object, but the actual action JSON files use a flat structure.

## Root Cause
Test expected: `prerequisite.condition.logic.condition_ref`
Actual structure: `prerequisite.logic.condition_ref`

## Changes Made
1. Updated prerequisite finding logic to look for `prereq.logic` instead of `prereq.condition.logic`
2. Fixed well-formed structure assertions to expect `logic` directly on prerequisite
3. Updated condition_ref format test to use correct path
4. Fixed JSON structure integrity test to expect `logic` instead of `condition`

## Result
All 36 tests now pass successfully.
