# IndexLLMController Test Fix Summary

## Issue
The test suite `tests/unit/indexLLMController.test.js` was failing because it had incorrect assumptions about:
1. The token name for the LLM adapter service
2. Whether the LLMAdapter service would be available

## Root Cause
1. **Token Mismatch**: Test was using `'ILLMAdapter'` but the actual token is `tokens.LLMAdapter` (which resolves to `'LLMAdapter'`)
2. **Incorrect Expectation**: Test expected LLMAdapter to NOT be registered, but when CharacterBuilderBootstrap runs with `includeCharacterBuilder: true` (default), it registers the LLMAdapter

## Solution Applied
1. Added import for tokens: `import { tokens } from '../../src/dependencyInjection/tokens.js';`
2. Replaced all string references `'ILLMAdapter'` with `tokens.LLMAdapter`
3. Changed test expectations from "should fail" to "should succeed" since LLMAdapter IS registered
4. Added `initialize()` method to test controllers (required by CharacterBuilderBootstrap)
5. Updated test descriptions to reflect correct behavior

## Key Learning
The CharacterBuilderBootstrap automatically includes character builder services by default, which includes the minimal AI infrastructure (LLMAdapter, ILLMConfigurationManager, etc.) needed for character generation features.
