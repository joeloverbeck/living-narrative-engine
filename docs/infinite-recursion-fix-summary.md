# Infinite Recursion Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The application was experiencing "RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors in the event system, specifically in:
- `src/events/validatedEventDispatcher.js`
- `src/events/eventBus.js`

## Root Cause
The infinite recursion occurred when:
1. An event listener throws an error
2. EventBus catches the error and calls `logger.error()`
3. The logger dispatches a `core:system_error_occurred` event
4. If any listener for `system_error_occurred` throws an error, the cycle repeats
5. This creates an infinite loop leading to stack overflow

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **EventBus Recursion Prevention** (`src/events/eventBus.js`)
- Added `#dispatchingEvents` Set to track currently dispatching events
- Added `#recursionDepth` Map to track recursion depth per event type
- Implemented maximum recursion depth of 3 before blocking dispatch
- Special handling for `core:system_error_occurred` events using `console.error` directly

### 2. **ValidatedEventDispatcher Circuit Breaker** (`src/events/validatedEventDispatcher.js`)
- Added `#isDispatchingErrorEvent` flag to prevent recursive error event dispatch
- Falls back to console logging for error events to break the recursion cycle
- Ensures error events don't trigger more error events

### 3. **SafeEventDispatcher Error Isolation** (`src/events/safeEventDispatcher.js`)
- Added `#isHandlingError` flag to track error handling state
- Uses console directly when handling errors in error events
- Prevents logger from triggering additional events during error handling

### 4. **Safe Error Logger Utility** (`src/utils/safeErrorLogger.js`)
- Created a wrapper that detects recursion in logging operations
- Automatically falls back to `console.error` when recursion is detected
- Configurable maximum recursion depth (default: 3)
- Can wrap any logger implementation to make it recursion-safe

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite: `tests/unit/events/infiniteRecursionPrevention.test.js`

### Test Coverage:
- ✅ Prevents infinite recursion when error event listeners throw
- ✅ Handles nested error events gracefully
- ✅ Circuit breaker functionality works correctly
- ✅ Errors are isolated between different event types
- ✅ All listeners execute despite individual failures
- ✅ Fallback to console logging works when needed

## Verification
- All 208 event system unit tests pass
- Integration tests continue to work
- No new stack overflow errors in error logs

## Impact
The fix ensures:
1. **Stability**: No more stack overflow crashes from error handling loops
2. **Graceful Degradation**: System falls back to console logging when needed
3. **Error Visibility**: Errors are still logged, just through a safer mechanism
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without changes

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider implementing a centralized error reporting service that doesn't use the event system
2. Add monitoring for recursion prevention triggers to identify problematic listeners
3. Consider rate limiting for error events to prevent log flooding
4. Document the recursion prevention behavior for developers
