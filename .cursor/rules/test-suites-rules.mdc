# Test suites guidelines

-In this project, we only create tests using the Jest framework. If you're working on a test suite and you see the opportunity to refactor some testing code to reduce duplication, do so, but those separate modules must all be under the tests/ directory of root (in appropriate subdirectories if necessary.)
-When you're tasked with fixing the failures in a test suite, always follow the following steps:
 1) Determine if the tests are still valid according to the logic in the SUT.
 2) Determine if the issue is with the SUT or the tests suite.
 3) If the issue is with the SUT, fix the bug, then ensure the corresponding test passes.
 4) If the issue is with the test suite, fix the test suite until the tests pass.

Guidelines to follow when creating test suites:
- Unit tests must accurately simulate real system behavior.
- Test mocks should match production interfaces exactly.
- "Compatibility" tests should actually test compatibility.
