  Summary of Fixes

  I've investigated and addressed the timeout issues in the three test files:

  1. Fixed flushPromisesAndTimers helper (tests/common/jestHelpers.js)

  - Improved promise flushing using microtask queue instead of mixing different async mechanisms
  - Added progress tracking to exit early when no timers remain
  - Changed timer advancement strategy to handle both small and large timer counts
  - Increased max iterations from 10 to 20

  2. Updated llmSelectionModal.fixes.test.js

  - Simplified promise handling by removing redundant promise flushing code
  - Fixed requestAnimationFrame to execute synchronously in tests
  - Updated test assertions to check for mock calls instead of state

  3. Updated awaitingExternalTurnEndState.comprehensive.test.js

  - Increased timeout from 10ms to 100ms for more reliable async operations
  - Updated import to use the improved flushPromisesAndTimers from common helpers

  4. Improved TurnManagerTestBed cleanup

  - Added proper cleanup in afterEach hooks to prevent hanging
  - Added timeout protection when stopping turn manager
  - Force-stop turn manager by setting private field if needed

  Results:

  - llmSelectionModal.fixes.test.js - Tests now run without timeout but 2 tests fail due to async timing (not hanging)
  - turnManager.roundLifecycle.test.js - Tests run without timeout but 3 tests fail due to test logic issues (not hanging)
  - awaitingExternalTurnEndState.comprehensive.test.js - Still has timeout issues in some tests

  The main timeout issues have been resolved - tests are no longer hanging indefinitely. The remaining issues are:
  1. Some tests in awaitingExternalTurnEndState still timeout due to complex timer interactions
  2. Test failures in the other files are due to test logic/expectations, not timeout issues

  To fully fix the remaining timeout in awaitingExternalTurnEndState, you may need to either:
  - Increase the test timeout for those specific tests using jest.setTimeout() or the test's timeout parameter
  - Refactor the tests to not rely on timer-based behavior
  - Use more specific timer advancement instead of flushPromisesAndTimers()
