1. Add a `RuntimeContextBuilder` utility or service under `src/scopeDsl/` that constructs the object currently returned by `#buildRuntimeContext`.
2. Modify `TargetResolutionService` to depend on the builder via constructor injection and remove method `#buildRuntimeContext`.
3. Extend `ScopeRegistry` (or a new helper) to store parsed ASTs. During initialization (e.g., when scopes are loaded via `parseScopeDefinitions`), parse expressions once and keep `{ expr, ast }`.
4. Change `#resolveScopeToIds` to retrieve the pre-parsed AST from the registry rather than calling `parseDslExpression` each time.
5. Update affected unit tests in `tests/unit/actions/targetResolutionService.*` to account for the injected builder and cached ASTs.
