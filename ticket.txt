1. In `src/logic/operationHandlers/modifyArrayFieldHandler.js`, extract:

   * `validateParams()` – return normalized params or `null`.
   * `fetchTargetArray()` (existing) – keep.
   * `applyModification()` (existing) – keep.
   * `commitChanges()` (existing) – keep.
   * Update `execute` to orchestrate these helpers with early returns.
2. Repeat in `modifyContextArrayHandler.js`:

   * Create `validateParams()` and `resolveArray()` helpers.
   * Keep or refactor existing modification logic into reusable functions.
3. Ensure all extracted helpers are private and covered by unit tests.
