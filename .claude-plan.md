# Mod Exploration Plan

## Task: Understand existing mods and their action content

**Scope**: Very thorough exploration of `/data/mods/`
**User Specifications**:
- Sample ~10 actions per mod (representative sample)
- Analyze ALL mods with manifest files
- Focus on action file names and content only

## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Inventory All Mods
- List all directories in `/data/mods/`
- Identify which are actual mod directories vs files
- Count total mods for tracking

### Phase 2: Per-Mod Analysis
For each mod directory:
1. Check if `mod-manifest.json` exists and read it
2. Check if `actions/` directory exists
3. If actions exist:
   - List action files (up to first ~15 to sample 10)
   - Read up to 10 action files to understand types/content
   - Categorize the actions (by purpose/type)
4. Note any mods without actions
5. Identify mod dependencies and relationships

### Phase 3: Synthesis
1. Create list of mods with actions + their types
2. Document mod-manifest.json contents for all mods
3. Identify any categorization patterns in existing actions
4. Note interdependencies between mods
5. Flag any unusual patterns or observations

## Expected Output
- Complete mod inventory (which have actions, which don't)
- Action type categorization per mod
- All mod-manifest.json contents
- Existing action grouping/categorization patterns
- Summary of mod relationships

## Parallel Execution Opportunities
- Can read multiple mod-manifest.json files in parallel
- Can sample action files from different mods in parallel
- Multiple directory listing operations can run concurrently
